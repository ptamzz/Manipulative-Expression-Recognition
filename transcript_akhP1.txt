KT: you don't support people from Arambai Tengol who have who claim that they have been told by Biren saying to raze Villages 

AKH: now that's just yet to be ascertain you are just floating up some

KT: quoting their tweets 

AKH: whatever but you we really don't know that 

KT: but what you're saying to me is you're distancing yourself from them 

AKH: yeah yeah you have nothing to do we are also an organization we work in our own line of objective and purpose they must have their owners and now so okay there is no connection at all

KT: let me then sum up this bit of the interview for the audience you are an organization that claims to represent all of panipur not just the meitei yeah unfortunately since the middle of may you don't have any kuki affiliation any longer but you do have some affiliation with some Naga outfits yeah right and secondly you distance yourself from the things that arambai thank God and my telepon has said you don't share those positions about annihilating or raising Villages

AKH: no no no no no 

KT: no that's a clear no?

AKH: yeah no 

KT: okay let's then come to another subject the Indian Express on the 27th of this month reported that on Wednesday and perhaps on Thursday representatives of your organization kokumi and I'm quoting now had a round of talks with an intelligence Bureau official representing the center can you confirm those talks

AKH: no we don't have any official meeting

KT: did you have an unofficial meeting

AKH: no 

KT: you had no meeting at all 

AKH: no

KT: so what are you doing in Delhi at the moment

AKH: we were here for a national press conference coordinating with the Meitei people trying to console them on this issue and we are also meeting some of the political leaders

KT: you know it's very interesting you should say you had no meeting with the intelligence Bureau the homeownist has gone on record to say that he's had 6 runs of meetings with Meitei organizations and separately 6 tons of meetings with Kuki organizations 

AKH: there may be other parts but not with COCOMI in this as you mentioned on 27th

KT: so when the home minister says that he's had six runs in meetings with is not one of them

AKH: not in recent times when we are in Delhi

KT: When You Say Nothing recent times when did you last speak to the home minister

AKH: When he was in imphal 

KT: that was right at the end of May 

AKH: yeah

KT: so since the end of May COCOMI has had no talks with anyone in government 

AKH: no 

KT: at any level

AKH: uh there was one guy from the IB and he invited us for a tea because uh he was here 

KT: so you are now confirming that there was a guy from IB who invited you for tea 

AKH: no no no see he works in IB but we were talking on a personal matter he was inviting me for the tea 

KT: when was this?

AKH: I think two days ago three days 

KT: so two days ago someone from IB invited you for tea?

AKH: yeah

KT: I wanted to talk about

AKH: he's a familiar person he was in imphal for quite some time 

KT: well what did you talk to him about. he sounds like the ideal sort of IB person to start talks what did you talk about 

AKH: that's that's not about the issue we didn't discuss much on issue

KT: but you do confirm that you were invited to tea by an IB official 

AKH: yeah but not a not on official capacity

KT: where did you meet him 

AKH: we meet him here in Delhi 

KT: in his office 

AKH: no 

KT: then 

AKH: in a place his place or somewhere I don't know I forgot the location somewhere

KT: his residence or some secret place 

AKH: yeah it's kind of residence kind of 

KT: or was it a secret house

AKH: no no I we we have no idea on that because he's a non-familiar uh you know he's a non-familiar person because he wasn't a person you don't know you're not familiar with inviting he's a familiar I mean he's a non k-n-o-w-n known person he was in imphal we had a he even speaks manipuri he was there for quite some time 

KT: he sounds like he's an ideal person from IB to start talks 

AKH: no no because we didn't discussion because there isn't any official 

KT: you didn't discuss or won't admit you discussed 

KT: no it's not like that because for sure I am not in the capacity to initiate a talk because...

KT: you are the spokesman of COCOMI

AKH: yeah but we I didn't come with an official mandate but..

KT: I'm not saying that you held the talks did your seniors in COCOMI holder talks

AKH: no nobody I don't have any information

KT: absolutely no don't have information or you don't know

AKH: No because we have to have the information I am part of the executives 

KT: is it possible that talks will help without your knowing 

AKH: no no that's impossible

KT: let me ask you two different questions status

AKH: no it's not about support or not support it's more about why this adult tribe demand has been plotted why we know should it be granted if you know just so tell me should it be granted that's the key show I'm asking you should it be granted no that's up to the government's but you must have a position on it no we don't have no we have no opinion as of now and said we'll try it 

KT: so COCOMI has no position no opinion on the schedule 

AKH: yeah 

KT: You neither supported nor opposite 

AKH: yeah

KT: you're absolutely clear 

AKH: yes we don't even discuss on several tribes in COCOMI's level 

KT: but the point you're saying is you don't support it you don't oppose it either 

AKH: we don't even discuss on this matter in the table of COCOMI

KT: what about the kuki demand supported by all 10 kuki mlas and also Now by kuki inp that they want a separate Administration and now Kuki INPI has made it clear that by separate Administration they mean a separate state I imagine as a manipuri organization you are opposed to that because it would involve the breakup of Manipur 

AKH: yeah

KT: but

are there any grounds on which you could

agree to it 

AKH: no no ground at all 

KT: ever

AKH: no you will never think of any possibility that you could agree to a separate Administration 

AKH: yeah even Heaven Falls it's impossible 

KT: Even If Heaven Falls

AKH: yeah it's impossible 

KT: impossible suppose the home Ministry to come and say to you the trouble in Manipur has gone on for too long the government has failed to quieten and restore peace in order the Army and the paramilitary are not succeeding either the only way to do it is to Grant the kuki separate Administration a separate Union territory what would you say

AKH: the home minister cannot decide everything on Manipur Manipur has its own position Manipur has its own history Manipur has its own conditions so he cannot decide everything on Manipur 

KT: or just a moment in 2019 this government decided everything about Kashmir on its own and it did it by surprise and the kashmiri people were not consulted the same thing could happen to you if the government feels that there is no other way of restoring peace and Harmony that's why I asked the question 

AKH: yeah for that they have to try and take a chance we will also take the same chance to respond in the right way 

KT: but you are saying to me that under no circumstances can you accept separate Administration 

AKH: yeah yeah

KT: okay the Hindu newspaper has reported that Assam rifles filed an fir against COCOMI and specifically against jitendra ningompa if that's how you pronounce his name the convener of COCOMI and you have been accused of suggestion of promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and race and also of defamation as spokesman of COCOMI how do you respond to this fir

AKH: firstly they have to prove that allegations number one that we are having that kind of religious issues and you know citing enemies between the groups and communities they have to prove it and I think Assam rifles is one of the key organizations who are directly or indirectly responsible in this current situation turmoil situation in Manipur 

KT: when you say responsible what are you saying

AKH: because they have committed so many faults 

KT: faults

AKH: yeah 

KT: such as 

AKH: such as when they initiate the 2005 so aggress ceasefire within kuki militants there wasn't any official informations to the state government when they formalize it on 2008 since then they have been working in coordination with the militant kuki militant Narco terrorist groups who are you know actively engaging in all sort of drug trafficking poppy cultivations bringing in of illegal immigrants and they are responsible for taking care of the international boundary

KT: I just want to make clear I've understood you correctly you're saying from 2005 and particularly from 2008 the Assam rifles have been working with siding with what you call kuki Nako terrorist let's leave the kukinaco Terrace out because people dispute whether that's a accurate or even fair description

AKH: Which people are you talking about

KT: The Kuki themselves full stop

AKH: We are telling, COCOMI is teling that

KT: and officially the government of India also doesn't accept the word terrorist as a description of

Kuki so let's leave that out 

AKH: no no, you can't do that

KT: I'm talking about Assam rifles you're accusing the Assam rifles of taking sides

AKH: yeah

KT: you mean that 

AKH: yeah

KT: according to the Hindu on the 10th of July COCOMI and I'm quoting gave a call to people not to surrender weapons is that right did you give such a call

AKH: no we didn't say that what did you say what we said is the the circumstances has made the people not let surrender their weapons 

KT: sounds like the same thing to me 

AKH: no because we are conveying the situation we are not uh what do you say we are not making a call we are conveying the situation

KT: what you're saying is the following we didn't ask people not to surrender weapons we explained why we are not surrendering

KT: you're sure

AKH: yeah that's what asaraf was misquoted because they are desperate now because there are so many allegations on Assam rifles the home minister has been brief on that the home minister himself assured us that some of the Assam rifles...

KT: When did the Home Minister give you this assurance 

AKH: when he was in imphal

KT: but this charge is 10th of July 40 days after you left 

AKH: yes yes because they are desperate now because we have certain inputs that initiative..

KT: You sure this wasn't something the home minister said you two days ago?

AKH: yeah we have certain inputs..

KT: or did the IB guy who invited you for tea said this

AKH: no no it's not really that we don't discuss on that matter 

KT: the Hindu also reports that COCOMI has alleged that a large number of women protesters were assaulted by the Indian army in the moirang area of vishnupur on June the 30th the Army has denied the allegation howconfident are you of this accusation

AKH: we have video evidence of the army molesting 

KT: not molesting they are they are they are beating the protesters and manhandling

KT: what community did the protesters come from 

AKH: Meitei

KT: so you have videos of the local TV channels as all reported National media avoided that news

AKH: which is why I'm asking you because unfortunately we don't have access to local media that operates in Manipur 

AKH: National Media were there but they avoid the news 

KT: but you're saying that you have videos 

AKH: local media already reported 

KT: these are videos from the 30th of June of the army assaulting and beating up yeah women protesters yes in moirang of Bishnupur yes this proof is there with you 


AKH: local media has already reported 

KT: but you've the videos

AKH: it's in the local media's library when you watch the news 

KT: when you go back to imphal I believe you're returning on Monday yeah can you send those videos to us 

AKH: sure

KT: that's the promise yeah yeah sure again according to the Hindu and I'm quoting in a memorandum to the home minister on June 4th COCOMI demanded that the Assam rifles be replaced with any other Central armed police force can you explain why do you want the Assam rifles replaced I've got a hint of it already but can you explain this specifically

AKH: Assam rifles failed to perform their duties properly some rifles is responsible for the Indo Myanmar border management and all this issue of illegal immigrants are because of their lacked in incapacity to control the international borders and Assam rifles is also responsible for all this drug trafficking drugs what you will be surprised over the past five years since 2017 till today the state has already seized and arrested drugs would 7 880 how do you know this it's report from the narcotic Affairs bureaus Manipur police department 

KT: and you're alleging that the Assam rifles is involved 

AKH: not involved but that they fail to uh you know control and seize this trafficking of drugs from across the border over the past 

KT: why would they fail to do something it's so obviously it's a job and it's so obviously wrong if they don't do it why would they fail to do it

AKH: you should ask Assam rifles 

KT: but you're the one who's bringing up the charge no one else

AKH: we are coming up with have we have recovered recently when there was a cabinet subcommittee uh before the you know detection of illegal immigrants it was headed by uh one of the kuki Minister Mr leper hockey and it comes out to our comes out that 2187 illegal immigrants were being left settled inside the Manipur territory must be knowing that because they are in charge of the whole area..

KT: So..

AKH: let me finish let me finish then what happened there are also they have also been allowed to build up proper cottages and houses despite the you know government's Assurance for a shelter home for those illegal immigrants or the refugees and there is also a camp for the VDF in new Gamphazawl area area
