KT: hello and welcome to a special interview

for the wire

my daily poon is one of the most

important organizations involved in the

present crisis in Manipur so today we

ask what sort of organization is Maite

lipon what Vision does it have for

Manipur and how is it conducted to

itself over the last Troublesome months

with me to answer those critical

questions is the one man who knows the

answers for sure he's the chief of my

telephone pramod Singh and Mr Singh has

specially flown down from imphal for

today's interview Mr promoting let's

start with that first key question what

sort of organization is Maite lipot is

it like the Maite a cultural

organization committed to the welfare of

the maipay people or is it as the cookie

say a vigilante militant chauvinist

organization that attacks cookies Begin

by telling the audience what sort of

organization is yours namaskar by teleport


PS: my telephone is a social cultural

organization we are trying to unite the

mateys in South and Southeast Asia and

have a culturally integrated entity

which was during our forefathers time

but today we are splitted everywhere so

we are trying to unite ourselves and

have a very culturally integrated


KT: but you said you are uniting the mighty

in South and Southeast Asia so actually

you're not just an Indian organization

you cover the other countries of the

region as well 


PS: as of now we are starting

only in Indian side that is also in

Manipur we have started already in Assam

but we are scaling down now because we

are concentrating in Manipur but will

you also be concentrating on Maite

people who live outside India yes sir

you will do that yeah so what sort of

countries would you be involved in we

will con uh invoke where the mites are

like Bangladesh in South Asia India then

Myanmar in Southeast Asia yes sir so all

of those will be coming yes now

something else that I discovered from

your tweets is that you don't consider

cookies to be part of Manipur in a tweet

that you issued on the 28th of May Which

is less than 10 days ago you call them

and I'm quoting Outsiders and not part

of the family you call them tenants yeah

so they have been sheltered by our Kings

and the britishers

uh maybe from 1872 they have been

sheltered and those they have been

sheltered in Manipur are staying as

permanent residence of Manipur

but the issue now is these people keep

Sheltering and bringing in more people

particularly from Bangladesh and Myanmar

side and who are dominating the local

population who are the indigenous but

you still today in 2023 called the

cookies Outsiders

[Music]

I call cookies because cookie is coming

from uh Myanmar side and Burma side they

are also cookie cookies those are in

Manipur who are the permanent residents

they are also cookie but who are The

Outsiders the the way the the more of

things this they do is very much against

Manipur and the interests of India now

so but they are dominated by that do you

stand by your Tweet you call them

Outsiders not part of the family

they are Outsiders in the same sense

that they are not indigenous people of

alipur they don't belong to Manipur they

have come from outside yeah they are

sheltered by us they are not indigenous

they are not indigenous how do you know

that on what basis do you say that on

the indigenous means those who have been

living for the thousands years Alice for

a couple of centuries living with like

my days and nagas have been living here

as indigenous people cookies we are

landed sheltered by this uh

let me point out something to you there

is an Indian national Army museum in

Manipur it is a very famous Museum

the museum commemorates and memorializes

182 people from Manipur who were

involved in the Ina

of that 182

154 a cookie 26 are mighty

most people would say this proves the

cookie are insiders that they belong to

India you say they are Outsiders they

are those who were brought by britishers

and there today they stay as permanent

residents of Manipur no there are

biharis they are

marwaris they are even gorkhas who came

during Second World War they all are

staying as permanent residence of

Manipur that doesn't mean that they are

indigenous people you're seeing a very

interesting thing you repeated called

cookies permanent residence yeah in your

Tweet you call them tenants yeah tenants

are people who stay as long as the

landlord wants them to tenants don't

have a right to stay permanently are you

saying like tenants the cookies don't

have a right to stay permanently in

Manipur I am referring to those cookie

who keep coming in no since 18 1980s

they have been coming continuously

coming over to Manipur infiltrated

illegally well this is a point point you

made also in an interview you gave to

vishwadeep Gupta the editor-in-chief of

the KRC times on the 20th of May you

said this is a fight between India and

illegal immigrants yes what proof do you

have of large-scale illegal immigration

happening

see these people who are fighting now

what the areas we are bordering with

Maite Villages they are not indians but

how do you know that they live in India

they are Indian citizens how can you

claim they're not indians see they have

we have been talking over with them over

you know walkie-talkies also they can't

speak manipuri they can't speak Hindi

they can't speak English the language

they are speaking also we cannot

understand no can I put this to you

and remember he's a BJP MLA he's a bgp

MLM underlining that in an interview to

me on the 9th of May

said there is no large-scale illegal

immigration happening in Manipur but he

accepts that maybe several thousand

myanmari's people have come running away

from the junta

but that's just a couple of thousand or

three or four thousand you're talking as

if the entire cookie population of

Manipur is illegal you insist that they

are only permanent residents you insist

that tenants which means they don't have

a right to permanently live there they

can only live there as long as landlords

let them

is that being fair to the cookie to

consider your own fellow citizens

Outsiders I am saying they keep coming

in so that is why people they are coming

and it has already been the data has

been published by the government it has

already been in the media not that I

didn't bring any but it has already been

there and the Central department it's

justice department they have already

pointed out the statistical Department

already pointed out the abnormal growth

in the populations of cookies no forgive

me you're making a point that Mr nothing

made and it was wrong no no forgive me I

must correct you Mr promotion because

it's wrong the cookie share of the

percentage of Manipur in 1901 was 14.5

percent

110 years later in 2011 it's 16 that's

an increase of 1.5 percent over 110

years that is not proof of video legal

immigration at all that's a natural

normal increase

the way I understand sir when you

contacted me I thought that you wanted

to listen to my opinion no so if we

really have to go to the datas no then

perhaps we fix another time then I will

also come with all the datas with we are

referring to then we can sit down and

discuss because I'm only pointing out

that your claim that the increase of

population of cookies is

disproportionate is not true the census

is not true no it's not true is what you

are saying based on the datas given by

the referring to what Paul Ilan said who

was the no no

uh first we are referring to the data

given by this Paul ilam who was the

spokesperson of Kano now he's a CP MLA

again you are also referring to some

data which I should be given a fair

chance to defend no for that I need to

sit down with you again and I also bring

some data but not now let's leave that

then

the point I'll underline for the

audience is that you stand by what you

said in your Tweet on the 28th of May

that the cookies are Outsiders they are

not part of the family that part is what

I was trying to explain but uh you bring

in the Thousand you are okay let's come

to other aspects of the my teleport not

others now let me clarify that partner

because this cookie infiltration is

happening you know since ideas and

particularly after Naga cookies conflict

the so many people of them are coming in

now and this Myanmar issue with Paulina

just mentioned which you've referred to

Just Happening yesterday only the only

thing is you keep saying so many are

infiltrating so many are coming in but

you have no facts to establish it that

has been published in media by the

government if you are not going to

believe which which Manipur government

yeah and the census is under Indian

government no they own

here sir

obviously your references I'll give it

to you again in 1901 the cookies were

14.5 percent of the population of

Manipur a hundred and ten years later in

2011 they are 16 that is an increase

over A Century of 1.5 percent that

cannot prove any illegal immigration if

you want I'll give you one more census

and this is the census of what 1990 1901

and 2011.

2011. and it has uh I got datas of 2021

also which is not yet published but it

is being already analyzed the census

hasn't been done they can't be a census

for 2021 it hasn't been done

published in public domain but this is

there was no census in 2021 the

government has postponed it

[Music]

the census has been delayed if this

almost complete that is only that it's

not coming out in public domain that's

what I was saying sir

there has been no census in 2021 it was

postponed and if it is uh post 2011 then

I'll I'll be able to give you the tatas

okay I have in my mobile let's move on

yeah we've established so we've

established that there is a difference

of opinion over the percentage and size

of the cookie population at this moment

I want to understand more about the my

day leapon what is your Charter what are

the objectives that you stand for yeah

we are trying to strengthen ourselves

and we are trying to have a

strong meters will only bring Integrity

of Manipur so foreign

strengthen what we believe in our

forefathers how they are dead they used

to have a live uh coexisted with those

tribes who are with us no so my Daily

Posts not only support the maitates we

are also developing the Oneness in

Manipur so whoever tribes in Manipur

they know us all so are you a cultural

organization yes a cultural organization

yes

relationship

with Chief Minister birencing in one of

your tweets dated the 29th of October

last year you said you worshiped him

other people say he is your Mentor he

guides you what's the relationship

between Michael lipon and birencing okay

uh this allow me to explain their

partner their part is very much I don't

know

issue now

Manipur was never immersed my never

colonized by Indiana we immerse entity

of Manipur and India we merge and as

part of Union of India when we we

immerse but wasn't Manipur part of

British India

Manipur was colonized by British but

what I am trying to say Manipur was

never colonized by India we immerse

participants in India didn't colonize

any country or any state all states

merged with India after Independence

that's what I'm saying let me finish no

we must as part of Union of India

and

after the merger agreement even in

merger agreement in the article 8 and

even after that there is Administrative

report which I have a copy of service I

can share to you as per the agreement

what India government guaranteed to us

is whatever

ligand framework but whatever Rule and

regulations which Manipur was following

pre-merger will be safeguarded by

government of India

I understand what is the relationship

with biren Singh today let me come to

there no so that was the agreement but

as I mentioned already since 1980s these

cookies have been infiltrating Manipur

and said illegal immigration immigration

is happening in large number

particularly from Bangladesh and Myanmar

side you say that I have to Simply for

the sake of the audience say there's no

proof of it whatsoever but please

continue

with me

so there

immigrated illegally in Manipur and over

time not only they infiltrated they

started having

internet migration

they will spread across chill areas in

the belly areas so that is where the

issue of space is there within how does

this connect with birencing I will I

will come to that I will come to that

let me come to them so because of

domination over space there has been

fight between nagas and my cookies

then the tension with Mayte have been

there since like this it is a

long-standing tension my days have been

watching because we are very tolerant

overpolarlessness so we're having

tolerance and the drivers who have been

going through the you know one thing yes

the audience listening to you yes will

say he hasn't answered Karen's question

what is your relationship with billions

instead but instead what you've done is

you have revealed a deep dislike for

cookies I am coming to this sir please

please give me two minutes no sir please

please I have requesting

so they have been killing the drivers

whenever they want they kidnap Ransom

and money has been extortion has been

happening no the cookies have been

killing and extorting money that's your

accusation drivers no it has been

happening so from drivers truck drivers

truck drivers and from the businessmen

and they have been destroying the

villages they have been doing poppy

Plantation they have been doing drug

trafficking it was never checked by

India

it's very interesting you should say it

was never checked by India you are part

of India you're not separate to India

because Forest is under India no it is

in the it is not in the status it is in

central is so what I'm trying to say

that there is a place called uyo the

nearby Hills where given by the king to

the nearby Village methane Villages so

it is our right to go there to look for

firewood for busy for visitables then

suddenly this cookie undergrounds the

abilities ensue came out and said no it

is ancestral land they cannot come the

truth is that the Hill Country in

Manipur which is 90 of the state is

considered tribal territory and the

Maite who live in the valley who are not

tribals cannot buy land that that is

part of the Indian constitution that is

part of the Indian constitution but I

asked you a different question so sir

I will come to when will you come to the

question I'm coming here no I'm coming

there since you have asked me to uh

invited me here to give my opinion let

me give no if you want to give your

opinion let's fix another time there

I'll come and listen to you know at

least listen me also because it has been

if it's not promote who is speaking it

is the aspirations of Maita is now

laughs which has never and this is

always unheard no this is what I'm

trying to express here that's why I'm

taking so much pain to come here also

also so these people

occupied the lands and said this is our

ancestral land you cannot come here you

cannot come here for looking for

firewoods they encross their they build

house they are

this we are just looking we cannot do

anything because the government of India

or government of Manipur never do

anything there was no governance in the

Hills

okay for the last more than 40 years so

this this you know this containment is

across different villages in Manipur I

understand this is this is the time when

BJP came to power and the BJP started

saying like we will give governance in

the Hills

we will preserve the uh deserve for us

we will control drug this is time when

they say it they are speaking the

aspiration of people of Manipur so

you're saying

if I understand you correctly you're

saying you worship biryan Singh because

he is standing up for Mighty interests

and mighty rights is that what you're

saying not my day right the right the

aspiration of the native people of

Manipur what the cookies and I'm talking

now about Pauline plant how to keep I'm

also talking about Mr hansing who's the

general secretary of the cookie National

Alliance both of them said to me

businessing is anti-cookie the very

reason you like him because he's

standing up for Mighty rights is the

very reason they don't like him because

they think he's anti-cookie

no no you are putting different so I'm

coming to why I I we worship

so when they are saying the same

aspiration which we have been talking

about demanding for the last 40 years

no we believe in that is the festival in

Manipur so we worship him we if you

worship him because he is standing up

for things that Maite is believe in he's

supporting Maite is against the cookies

that's what you're saying

we worship him because he stands for the

wishes of the indigenous people of

Manipur which is the mighty and you

don't believe the cookies

are also indigenous no but not the

cookies cookies are not indigenous then

yeah yeah you call them Outsiders yes

you say that you agree okay two things

have been established because if they

are permanent residents of India they

should be for Manipur they have given

land they have given they are in the

political sphere also let me move on

you've established two things one that

you have a deep dislike for the cookies

secondly you worship biryan Singh

because he's standing up for what you

call the rights of the mic how do you

say I I dislike cookies it comes out in

your conversation it comes after what

you're saying about them you accuse them

of murder of extortion you call them

illegal immigrants you say they keep

flooding into the country yeah because

you call them outside us because they

never behave the way the Indians are

they are behaving like the those who are

yet to come no they are only serving the

interests of Outsiders let's move on

beyond the cookie problem I want to

still understand the maithili point

the Maite leap on social media post show

in between you have also asked something

like uh sorry

empty cookie right I didn't say it

Wilson lamell hunctions had it and the

power and by the way Mr haukid is a BJP

MLA he's calling his own chief minister

Auntie cookie yeah yeah that Paulina I

know he was the spokesperson okay no now

he's a BJP uh I believe he says

General Secretary of the knee which is

an ally of the BJ okay I don't know I I

will sit there let's move on now let's

move on

your social media posts show that you

run physical training caps what sort of

training is given there we had been we

have been anticipating no that any form

of uh crisis may happen among my taste

it could be

Wildfire it could be fire it could be

flood anything for that we have been

training our people to none come back no

but what sort of training like uh if

some uh if somebody is injured how to

evacuate them and the old women and the

children how to evacuate them in the

separate places if there is fire how to

control it so this is this is more than

PT and yoga yeah isn't it do you give

them weapons and arms training no no

weapons so

you give weapon alarms training no no

but those who have a gun license they

they give they need some training to

apply for license which uh sometimes

do you give weapon training to people

who have gun licenses

the those who wants to apply for

licenses they need this uh standing no

passive training for that we give you do

give in collaboration with rifle clubs

so you do give weapon training

now tell me what are the links between

the mighty lipon and the RSS and the

bajiranga is the mighty deep on part of

the bjp's hindutva fraternity I ask

because you have clearly a Hindu Soul

around your neck

I am only foreign following how how I

was taught by my parents and I choose to

wear it no absolutely which is why I

asked are you connected to the RSS I

choose to wear it in the same way you

used to wear a tie you know same thing

absolutely but are you connected is my

telephone connected to any of the

hindutva groups that support the BJP do

you have linkages with them we have not

linked cases officially but I am a busy

ABP guy you while I was doing my

graduation in MA in Gujarat yeah does

the organization have any formal

linkages with either RSS or majoranka no

I don't have but no not you make the

loop on the organization no no we don't

have but I uh a bbp has a strong

influence on me on you yeah is that a

personal influence or does it extend to

the organization no I'm talking about

myself only a big influence on me yeah

but is there a link between abvp and my

telephone no we are not maybe people are

speculating because we participate in

Republic day period which is being

banned in Manipur by underground

elements and obviously you won't be

aware but we go for Republic Day Fair ad

every year and also people must be

thinking that we are RSS and also as I

said we are supportive of and because he

speaks about aspirations you know which

Outsiders will not if I understand you

correctly you said people suspect your

RSS but you're saying to me you have no

formal linkage with the RSS

no

or else and wise we don't have what

about the arambai telong

are you in any way connected with them

or is it just a sister organization and

secondly are you as close to the

Maharaja as the thing goal is

I am very close to Maharaja every methi

is every manipuri is but we are not

related with arambai arambai I wanted to

meet them once but they didn't agree to

meet with inmate so I don't know who are

they who are the leaders also I don't

know we are not connected it sounds as

if there are differences between you

no differences we we haven't met only

I don't know these people but one thing

I know about them is better they are

very patriotic they must I know because

the places where the Blazers are

defending their beliefs from attacking

from by issue militants

organization

no because I don't know what their

ideology is okay

we've discussed the mighty deepon in

some detail you've explained what sort

of organization you are you've explained

how you look upon berencing you've

explained how you look upon the cookies

let's now come I haven't I haven't

explained what my telephone is I was

only answered please do so go ahead yeah

tell me yeah I think people believe in

Oneness or Manipur with our forefathers

have been preserving you know so we have

strong relationship with all the tribes

those tribes who are listed in the

several tribes no those that you

consider indigenous and you don't count

the cookie is one of them I'm just

clarifying that this cookie also they

know me very well no because we work

closely but only thing is I was saying

you should work in the interest of

Manipur in the interest of India

by those who are permanent residents not

Sheltering and bringing and always

talking I have to keep repeating that

the allegations that you make that the

cookies are constantly bringing in large

number of illegal immigrants is not

proven it is simply your allegation it's

denied by BJP mlas as well but I don't

want to keep repeating the point I'm

only saying it because you're saying it

Bishop MLS doesn't mean that whatever

MLA says everything it is right you

cannot say no okay because I don't know

this where this 100 mlas are who's shown

to protect the Integrity of Manipur and

India are now in the bunkers now so we

don't know who are they also

people are sworn to uphold the Integrity

of India no one takes no one takes a

note to uphold the Integrity of a state

the Oaths that an MLA takes is to uphold

the Integrity of India and to stand by

the Constitution and Earth

means as well it means also the

Integrity of the people living there

which includes the cookies but let's not

quarrel on that I want to come now

because I think it's important you

should have a chance to answer what has

been said about the Maite lipun's

Behavior right through me okay I'm

talking about the way your organization

behaved when the troubles were happening

foreign

on the 12th or 11th of May he said when

the trouble in Manipur was at its worst

Tango were indulging in violence I want

to quote him he says they were in black

clothes and moved around in a group of

hundreds on bikes with guns they entered

police stations and police training

centers and looted the Armory they burnt

churches looted Villages and created

Havoc like anything

this is your organization he's talking

about as the chief of the mighty lipon

how do you respond to that no no he

knows nothing because we we are not even

there you know when the things were

happening in imphal

so where were you we were busy defending

the villages where the cookie militians

are attacking we were busy evacuating

the women and the children in the safer

places we are busy coordinating with the

security forces so you you didn't enter

police stations and police training

centers you did include the Armory you

didn't burn churches Villages whatever

happened in the belly we are not there

we were in the periphery we were in the

periphery because we we were a lot that

something will happen

shall I go detail on this we knew that

something is going to happen by January

23.

we already knew something is going to

happen that we didn't know in what scale

it will happen within now but something

is going to happen we already knew you

know can I point out to you what you

said in a tweet on the 28th of April

five days before the troubles began I'm

quoting your Tweet let's annihilate our

traditional rival on the hills and live

peacefully clearly this is proof that

you intended to Target and if you you if

you read carefully then you will

understand what I am saying I am not

saying about my thing that is not what

that's the tweet that is underlined what

you said that is your Tweet it says

promoting on top that's what I'm saying

give it to me give it to me no I'll tell

you this is not what I write it is just

a metaphors no it is not what I am

saying it is like what people are

thinking this is what I have said but

it's not this is not what I say your

exact words are let's annihilate our

traditional rival on the hills and live

peacefully and you haven't said that you

are quoting other people yeah you have

put this across as your own opinion

maybe the way I express you confuse see

there I am saying let's listen to

missionaries I am not missionary I don't

listen to missionaries but you're

advising people you're advising people

to listen to them saying let's

annihilate our traditional rival just

put it this way that another group is

saying that it will give meaning not by

my telephone

the problem is I'm just saying this is

the Outlook of some people

the problem some people who are not my

face the problem is that tweet was

issued five days before the trouble

began many people will look at that

tweet and say clearly Mr promotion and

the might they leap on were intending to

attack the cookies that's what it means

when you say let's annihilate them no no

no no no not that CCC I'll say I'll tell

you it is like my day has some rivalry

with some other groups so these groups

let's bring them in a common platform in

the name of uh Thrive that's what some

group is saying and let's finish up my

taste was finished up let's finish up

these people again that is what it means

I'll tell you why people will not

readily accept that explanation

let me finish the nuances the troubles

began on the 3rd of May when the old

tribal Student Union of Manipur held a

rally that was third of May please note

the date third of May 24 hours earlier

on the second the official Maite leapon

handle issued a tweet calling for a

counter blockade from the second night

I.E the night before the troubles began

and that tweet said it is our duty to

enforce our position physically many

people will look at this tweet of the

second of May and your earlier tweet of

the 28th of April and conclude clearly

might they leapon was wanting a fight

with the cookies the rally was just an

excuse or at Western opportunity no no

that is just a skateboard thing you know

because even before May 2 they already

started burning zombies uh baby cookies

uh no no other cookies started running

down the forest offices and when they

started killing the maites in torbung

area there was it was at four three pm

CPM when methane reacted it was at 7 pm

and as for that counter countering the

broken that we have been doing for all

this year because we feel that whenever

they have some things they want to

demand something they always put my

thing then something but no problem but

the problem about that tweet is that

you're talking about so counter block

almost the blockade has happened they

were they always broke the village uh

highways then when uh put us Advance

some if Government extended for talk

they will say okay we will withdraw the

broker we will talk with government

we'll talk women then we're talking

government but we are disagreements so

we'll put back the uh this uh broken

again like our opinion was never taken

we are used as a tool no to pressurize

the government this tactics is communal

which we feel so we have taken an

official position that whoever broke the

highways targeting methods we will

counter it is

happening for all this year and it never

went to the communal Riot which happened

who was the uh Brian yeah I can accept

that you want to counter a blockade

because the blockade disrupts life but

you want simply countering the blockade

five days early you said let's

annihilate our traditional driver on

this that is what I'm saying what is I'm

trying to say some non-metal groups how

they think is what I'm saying but it's

your language you're not saying other

people think like that that's how you

think so I didn't say other how other

people think I didn't say that you

confused you think it is what I say no

you're saying no means that you express

yourself badly it is worth some none my

thing that is how they think and that's

what I'm presenting if you did it again

you will know it is for uh non-hindus

also not by us in an interview that you

give Gupta the editor-in-chief of the

KRC times on the 30th of May sorry 20th

of May you said that the right on the

3rd of May and I'm quoting you was

planned by kooky illegal militants yes

what proof do you have with that

and please don't interrupt no yes I

requested earlier because let me give

the background because you cannot just

read a statement and come to the

conclusion so so by January 23 I got an

information that something is being

planned okay January 23 I remember

because that day I I attended an

occasion that's why I remember the death

there these cookies are planning to have

a rally on

sometime in May if this the cold peace

rally and misusing the private platform

they are planning him you knew this in

January

in January but the rally was a result of

the high court decision which was

announced in April how could you know

this in January that's what I'm saying

no sir this one I'm saying

that is what they are planning to do

something based on the tribal platform

which made January 23 I was already

informed but it wasn't just the cookie

held that rally on the third of me the

nagas were participating in very large

number as well this is what I went

coming there now can you please listen

now just just two minutes please just

two minutes I'm requesting

January 23 I am informed by some people

they said they are planning something

big sometime in April or May that's what

they told me I said something big what

they said something big we are planning

by some tribes

type leaders including the cookies

then in the process slowly slowly it

comes to the Homeland issues of cookies

so this tribe withdrew okay

this type we do and they give me the

input so this these people are planning

something that is when high court order

came out that the recommendations should

be given to the this central government

government not by the step then the

rally was planned then I gave this this

information to the security people

then about 15 days later another input

came they said they are planning they

are planning very much is something

going to be very big so among these

cookies in whoever describes all the

trash are not

agreeing with this plan so this tribes

also are also giving me inputs then this

I give the security people again then

they said so you work very closely with

the security people it seems no

everybody is working with security

people who are strong with that this

time when my days were you know serious

and killed I was it was me come back

come back to the story you're telling us

myself come back to the story you're

telling and the police yeah so when I

give the information to the security

people they were saying like no what

something is going to happen you cannot

give you cannot you cannot you don't

know this is planned by Cookie illegal

militants that's what you said to

vishwarya Gupta how do you know that

this is what I was told that go back

home

that I will not tell you but how do you

know it's authoritative how do you know

it's correct they could be misleading

you

no they are saying we were going

together planning it but slowly slowly

it comes to cookie Homeland issue so we

withdraw

so they are going ahead with a plan

these cookies that's what I was told

but you won't say who told you I won't

say and you can't establish whether the

person who told you actually can verify

because I provide evidence I find

horrible information they give has been

very reliable that's why I took it very

seriously but you won't say who they so

I told twice then the security people

are saying you don't specify what kind

of things is going to happen so just

giving information don't give you know

you've mentioned then about one week you

can ask you one question because it will

be occurring to the audience as you

speak four or five times you said I told

the security people I told the security

people does them like they leap on

operate as a sort of attached wing of

the security and the government is there

a close connection not just with

birencing but with the security agencies

no we are connecting connected with all

the security people

in what sort of way what sort of

connection because Manipur is a troubles

that so they we need to connect with all

the security people now that's how

cookies are connected we are connected

so what

so we are connected

so we told them and the third time when

I told them they said enough of all this

nonsense don't give more input so I gave

up

then May 3 when they plant this

so-called peaceful in peace rally then I

told my people this could be the plan so

be prepared be stay alive

so as we expected but after all that you

are saying you still insist that bhakta

Charan Das is wrong when he says they

entered police stations and police

training centers they looted the Armory

they burnt churches looted Villages

created Havoc I don't know he got that

information that can be Dil in the court

method I think because if if you said he

mentioned our name because we are your

name and also around this is

we have no access to those things no so

I will follow it up later on he also

spoke to the Hindu and to the Hindu he

said you had destroyed 200 churches

including wear this right 200 churches

including 18 belonging to the Maite

community and two to the nagas he said

this to the Hindu on the 13th of May no

no I didn't say that

I didn't say Mr bhakta Charan from the

Hindu oh he said no yeah because I don't

know from where all those promising

collected let me raise the last issue

because it's one that matters to the

Maite very deeply it is what I call the

land imbalance in Manipur the maity are

53 percent of the population let me

finish

I was trying to explain you have started

another topic

I asked you what proof you had that the

riot was the work of cookie illegal

militants you said you had been told

this but you won't tell me who told you

and therefore I can't establish how

authoritative that person is that you

said unless you give me the sauce to

explain My Views go ahead and how can I

I said

go ahead no so now we knew something was

planned okay either you accept or not we

knew then May 3 when they declared this

piece really then I said oh this could

be the one they are planning something

so prepare

protect your Villages this is what I

told my people

then

by then they started burning down the

fourth third no they started before that

also you must have heard they were

shouting solo guys killed methods and

they were burning the forest police

officers I also heard slogans on

WhatsApp saying kill the cookies

no no I'm talking

three second I'm talking about three

seconds because the tension was already

created not by that time and they were

burning down gym which was to be

innovated by CM then they are starting

abusing CM so many things happen then

May 3 came

already angry but they were silent then

in the name of rally they when they came

for rally what they did all of them

carry catapults with the iron balls

backwards of them all of the umbrellas

and it is not peace rally and on the way

they were burning the business officers

government offices then by three they

attacked my three villages with

catapults you're saying captivates and

iron boards the rallies are carrying but

not with guns but with catapults the

guns later on we see militants also with

guns in the rally yeah okay and you

believe this is illegal cookie militant

work that's the question I asked you yes

so then they were

attacking material villages

reacted by burning down cookie

properties killing cookies that's how it

happened no

[Music]

that that fairly incriminatory tweet of

yours of the 20th of April suggests that

the mighty began it because you said

five days before the troubles let's

annihilate our traditional rival on the

Hills you are repeatedly saying that now

yes I said listen

is to be said by some non-mete groups

this one you immune it completely then

you will understand that's what I saying

that's what you're saying here

the tweets

the Tweet does not say you are referring

to what someone else said the Tweet says

this is your opinion

teeth doesn't say that one nanmaita is

saying thinking like this I didn't put

that line that's why you got confused

now let's now come to an issue which is

of fail of very great importance because

it underlies the problem in Manipur The

Landing patterns you're not also saying

hundred uh 200 uh burned down that was

to the Hindu that I didn't know I am not

aware let's move on

I want to talk about the land imbalance

which is a critical issue in Manipur the

Maite are 53 54 of the population but

they are restricted to 10 percent of the

land the valley eight percent the

tribals are 40 of the population cookie

and Naga together

they not only have access to 90 which is

the Hill Country but they can also buy

land in the remaining 10 so the Maite a

53-54 restricted to ten percent the

tribals are 40 when they have access to

over 100. most people would agree this

on paper is unfair it needs to be

remedied question I want to ask is this

do you believe that schedule tribe

status for the Maita is the right way of

remedying this problem

that part of I don't know and you are

you do not know from the beginning also

you are wrong that

they can live in the ten percent the 90

percent are for tribes wrong actually my

take is by land in the Hill area you're

right with permission of District

councils but that's very rarely given

that's why I never mentioned this is not

like this

can live in the eight percent

wish

obvious if you subtract the reverse the

blacks the roads the government

buildings we are and the Pedic fields we

are living only in three fashion that is

one and

this uh Hills also they are protected

areas reserved forests and price can

live only in The Villages which are

given by the government

through a order no they cannot just live

everywhere now it is a forest has to be

protected it was protected during King's

time but I'm asking a different question

do you believe scheduled tribe status

for the Maite is the right way of

handling so

Kings used to protect this Visa Forest

which We call we know okay okay we know

that okay no no no no you don't know

that's why I'm telling

it was protected by the king

and when we merged with India India

guaranteed that they will protect means

they will follow what was being followed

post be murder so when in their neighbor

do them these people the infiltrators

they just came and stay anywhere I am

required to counter what you're saying

because you're suggesting that the

cookies have been deliberately and

steadily encroaching onto reserved

forests the cookies denied they denied

vehemently and in fact Mr haukip who's a

BJP MLA says this is because the might

they don't understand the structure of

cookie Villages there is no encroachment

it is just the villages tend to spread

in a particular cookie fashion

what I am saying the system is says that

India government has guaranteed that

this whatever rules and regulations

prevailing three merger will be followed

and protected by the India okay and but

it was guaranteed by through

customization and now when I have to

point out to you that apart from you and

apart from biryan Singh who has publicly

accused The Cookie of encroaching onto

Forest Reserve gland the cookies

themselves denied denied vehemently so

let's not get in no no what is because

it serves no purpose yeah no no cookies

deny doesn't mean that is right and your

assertive it doesn't mean it's right

either yeah yeah so let's be honest both

sides are challenging each other and

that's because there is no trust between

both sides and I want to come to the

question of trust but before I come to

the question of trust tell me the

earlier question asked do you believe

scheduled tribe status for the Maite is

the best way of securing the land they

want I I didn't go into this uh thing I

think it is not timely it is not timely

no because cookies are misusing this

tribal platform no on this because

nagasa also not agreeing with this but

you're saying a very important thing

yeah you don't support

the demand for scheduled Drive status

for the Maita you think it's not timely

yeah it is not timely in the sense that

cookies are misusing this to start at

Brian no so

this method is demanding some of my

taste demanding SD I don't know what it

is about what but you don't support I

don't you don't support I don't support

I don't protest

I don't oppose I don't support I am

neutral on this

this is a very important thing you said

I'll simply underline it because I think

the audience should know you are the

chief of the mighty leap on but you do

not support the demand for scheduled

tribe status you are neutral on it you

do not support the demand that's the

important thing you do not I do not

support I do not protest I do not oppose

yeah let's then come to what many

believe is the key problem and that

would have been clear right through this

interview there is no trust between the

cookie and the mighty

you look upon them as Outsiders you

don't consider them to be citizens you

call them tenants and as I said tenants

can only live as long as the landlord

permits them tenants don't have a right

to live permanently

no this is an absence of trust see how

do we tackle let's not go back into the

story how do we tackle the trust deficit

see sir there's no trust division might

they accepted fully the nagas accepted

fully those cookies who are permanent

residents

together in the business we are in the

Portugal sphere please call them

citizens you keep calling them permanent

residents they are citizens

there are two types of citizens the

indigenous citizens the permanent

residents they are also citizen forgive

me one type of citizenship in India and

everyone who's a citizen is an equal

citizen please don't try and distinguish

between them

I am saying the citizens in one Indian

citizen in Manipur

in Manipur some had been there for

centuries some were brought by British

they are also I'm forgetting that in

1917 there were the cookie British was

have you forgotten that no no no

17 they were cookie British was the

cookie fought the British in 1917. no

there never was they erected a gap today

it doesn't mean that they had you know

fabricated history doesn't mean that it

was

no it was there never was Anglo cookie

War

they were part of some Expedition with

Manipur Raza the cookies were used

that's all this is the problem you don't

regard the cookies as Citizens as Indian

you call them Outsiders no no that is

why there is

no sir I don't know where the session is

going it is not what you suggested also

anyway what I've I'm I was saying the

permanent residence of Manipur who were

sheltered by the British now they are a

permanent residence they are the citizen

of India

and the indigenous people who have been

living for centuries they are also

citizens of India that's what I'm saying

there we have no difference

but these people keep Sheltering

elegant immigrants

prove it that they are Sheltering

illegal immigrants and I keep telling

you that the census shows that there is

no illegal immigration look if you want

the only way you can prove it is if the

cookie numbers have gone up

disproportionately in that sense in that

case then I think maybe in the afternoon

we can sit down again I'll bring all my

data it is with my Free People

since we cannot we will not go through

the tatas I am only trying to tell my

opinion if you are ready to talk about

data

I'm talking about data that is publicly

available the census that is what I'm

thinking can I point out one thing to

you so the population of the coupon data

you have or what data cookie has is the

correct one what data I have is wrong

one is that what you are saying or no

I'm telling you that the technology that

the the according to data there is no

elegant influence infiltration then for

the last more than 40 years since 1985

there was another Riot also and all this

happening because it is all lies then

instead what yourself trying to say you

tell me something yeah what percentage

of cookies are illegal

yes

that is why we are demanding NRC now now

because the tatas we are showing the

proposed in proportional increases too

much no it is not only for Manipur it is

a threat for whole note is now

give the Manipur population today as

opposed as a by the 2011 census is 2.76

million according to 2011 census and the

cookie population is 4 lakh 48 000 ohm

compared to 1950

both the cookies and the holes of

Manipur have both grown five times it's

exactly the same proportionate increase

no that is a manipulated data you are

referring to I'll give the government of

India government one I'll give you I'm

giving you government data government

one I'll give because let's end tell me

something

the last question

you are referring to I don't know and

the census of India government of India

you are referring to I don't know the I

I'm bringing all the authentic ones let

me position my last question

you consider the cookies Outsiders you

say the majority are illegal immigrants

you call them tenants which means they

have no rights

why then are you opposing their demand

for a separate Administration if they

are Outsiders why do you want to keep

them in Manipur when I call them

Athenians

not as Indian citizen or Manipur citizen

that's what you call them sorry

you said when you called them what was

the word I never heard you said no no

yeah you call them that yeah yeah when I

call them Tina because suppose you live

in my house you may live as a guest or

you may live just an outsider no so

sometimes the way they behave see if

they are really tribal the tribals we

knew they love their land they love

their forests

cookies are guests in India yeah

and

and like guests

they can be thrown out

those infiltrators based on some cut

here but you said the majority are

infiltrated

so the majority of cookie should be

thrown out of India yeah they based on a

yeah

it was very grateful to you for having

come and spoken to me

we've spent a lot of time discussing

this issue I think a fairly clear idea

would have been given to the audience

about the problem and how you view the

cookies I'm grateful for the honesty

with which you've explained everything

and sir

this

uh

if we don't stop the illegal image

immigration today though it is Led

are in this plight today

not because

not because they are weak or not because

in ill again strong

they are in this plight today because

India was always neglecting them the

Hindu population

were never understood the situation by

the time they wake up they were already

driven up I don't want to start I don't

want to start a new argument with you

but I will point out one thing for the

audience

that it's almost impossible for the

Maite to become like kashmiri pandas for

one simple reason the Maite are 54 the

majority of Manipur the kashmiri pundits

were never more than a fraction of the

population of the valley never more than

a fraction so why comparisons are simply

not possible no no no it is not the

number number they will keep increasing

because they keep coming by these the

population that is sinking now now why

Maite will not be same as Pandit is not

because of the percentage it will be

because

this is our small Duty

to live the land intact as it was gifted

To Us by our forefathers which borders

were marked by the breaths of our

forefathers which were gifted to us and

it is our sole responsibility to give it

back to our future generation so to us

it is not just cookie and Maite

issue to us it is a foreign aggression

which we have been fighting

during our time during British time now

this is time we have to fight back so

yeah you cannot we cannot you cannot

just look at as a localized cookie

versus issue the most important thing

you've done versus illegal immigration

issue and

thinking that we are fighting a foreign

aggressor so this thing will just get

over it will increase the problem is

going to give us yeah it will get worse

because

what you should understand no cookie

Society

are only of two types very rich and very

poor very easy and very illiterate

those on the top say those in the below

follows maitai Society very rich very

poor middle class middle upper class

lower middle and in between there are

many many stratas are in my table last

night so now the bear is happening in

every strata of my time society as it is

happening in civilized society you know

this will take time okay it will take

time

but debate is going on every state every

family every three store people are

discussing now okay now

by the time we come to a common

consensus when all the discussion go

through this

comes to a common consensus then a blow

will come that blow will be so strong

that now what is a blow what do you mean

by blow a blow will come from a reaction

those Direction on third was just that

everything was just writing but they

kill they killed

are you saying to me that in sometime in

the future

the mighties will hit back hard against

that's what I'm saying that there's the

message I'm carrying here this is why I

came here because specifically when you

say bro do you mean you will launch a

war

you please listen sir what I am trying

to say

all the stratas by these are discussing

now yeah I understand in a civilized

society it takes time to prepare decide

Society the discussion is going on which

people think it is disunity no my things

are the most unified community in

Manipur because

two tribes my things are also comprised

of seven clans seven tribes you know but

when we meet MIT when I meet amazing we

don't even actually described he is he's

amazing that's enough no such a unified

Community now the discussion is going on

by the time we come to a consensus no

then there will be a blow from myself

what is can you explain what do you mean

by blow that we don't know

when that blow Comes This 15 kilometer

stress like cold can Pope where these

people are blocking the uh essential

Commodities listening to my state

population do you really think that this

15 kilometers this blow will just wipe

out

you but the blow will wipe out the

cookies the whole population will be

Wipe Out the whole cookie population yes

this 15 kilometers because they have

been blocking this essential Commodities

listening to maintenance and so you are

you are talking about a campaign of

attack against the cookies it will

happen because it will not happen people

are saying that as if he was The

Ultimate N

the cookies have already said this is

genocide against them what you are

saying sounds very much like that too

this may 3 Program

when they plan all those policemen the

irbs of cookies already on left or the

officers were all live they knew

something is going to happen I have to

point there's a big plan and Mr

President United

as a responsible anchor I have to point

out that what you are saying when you

talk about blow when you talk about a

military attack against the cookies is

sounding like genocide and I have to

point out as a responsible anchor this

is not the right thing for you to be

saying no no what I am saying since this

need to be told to the Indian people

then whatever fighting now it is in the

Pockets where my table lasers are

defending but what I'm saying Maite

Society is discussing now and will come

to a Consciousness

then the blow will come this and this

blow is a military attack no yeah what

is it then

will respond yeah to respond yeah

that response will be military you said

so you agreed earlier no no let me put

it very soon they plan and everybody

United and given us a blow on third my

thing is you have to give him yeah but

what will the blow be what will this

response be

I'm going to stop this here yeah because

I think you know forgive me I'm stopping

this here because we're getting into

territory which is dangerous you are

sounding as if and at times you have

even agreed that there will be a

military attack on them

what I'm saying that is a whole is not

reacted yet yes only The Villages but

when the blow comes it you said quite

clearly that you will blow them out of

that 15 kilometer area all the cookies

will be removed and killed you said so

so you said so oh that is what I said

yeah

I mean perilously close to what to some

will sound like not just a military

attack but planned deliberately

because I don't think we should be

continuing along these lines

particularly when we are talking about

fellow citizens of India I thank you Mr

promotion for coming no I thank you for

your honestly and I thank you for

revealing the English

so this is the right time that India

should intervene that's what I'm trying

to say because the blow is coming from

my face head so this is the action will

be there so you're giving away so you're

giving a warning to the government of

India yeah and the Manipur government no

what you're saying here it doesn't know

but what you're saying to the Manipur

government and to the Modi government is

intervene now if you don't there will be

a terrible blow that's what you're

saying no foreskin stuff and no one can

stop it

earlier you agreed that that could be

military that the cookies would be wiped

out of a 15 kilometer and we will have

said that they will there will be a

civil war a civil war this Civil War

from Maita said will be it would be able

to uh they won't be able to defend also

so India government should prepare many

programmers should prepare because

that's what you're saying at last we've

got to it that's what you're saying to

the Indian government you're saying it

to the Manipur government intervene now

otherwise there will be civil war yeah

there will be it is yet to come now

people thought the military already came

no it is just a small spark I'm glad at

last you've explained it I thank you for

coming I thank you for the most

important thing you've done you've

revealed the anguish of the Maite people

as you see it and I think it's important

that India should understand all your

fellow Indians your position and and

this they are saying that what my

teleport did was wrong no we were

evacuating our women our children

we were rescue them and putting in the

suffer flesh with their groups like

cookie in pkso and we have to also must

be doing the same for their own

Community when they do the same which we

did when cookies are blaming us why not

they are cooking why not they blame them

for the same accent which we did we have

gone on so I think for now we have to

now stop this

I think the most important thing you've

done is to express the anguish of the

Maite which has come through very

clearly the other thing we've done is

you've given a clear warning to the

Indian government and to the Manipur

government intervene now otherwise there

will be civil war

she will work this time the cookie

cannot defend oh this is of the bro that

is on the record at the moment it's on

record Civil War this time the cookies

cannot defend yeah because the blow will

be no no no this of the Republic it's

not it's on record the interview is not

over okay when the interview ends it'll

all be off record but at the moment it's

on you've said to the government both in

Manipur and in Delhi intervene now

otherwise there will be civil war and

you said the cookies can't defend it I

thank you for your openness and I thank

you for coming all the way from far

stay safe and please stay peaceful hi

I'm Karan thapar over the last few years

I hope you've been watching my program

the interview on The Wire

during that period I've interviewed

doctors politicians businessmen

scientists authors and even the

occasional Nobel Laureate for me it's

been exciting I hope it's been enjoyable

for you but these as you know are tough

times and if this program is going to

remain bold independent and sometimes

even defiant then I think we need your

support

at the end of the day it's a truism but

editorial Independence is best defended

by the viewers so if you would like this

program to remain the way it is

forthright outspoken and interesting

then would you consider supporting us

all you have to do is to click on the

description at the bottom but more than

anything else I hope you will continue

to watch the interview

your viewership means an awful lot to me
