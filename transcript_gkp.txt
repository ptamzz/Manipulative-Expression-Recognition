KT: Hello & welcome to a special interview for the wire. Tomorrow the Manipur assembly meets for its Monsoon session & today we ask how effectively have governments in Delhi & Imphal handle the crisis & more importantly what are the steps necessary to handle the Law & Order situation & beyond that the tricky but not irresolvable political issues that underlight those are the key concerns I should raise today with the former Home Secretary whose knowledge of the Northeast & Manipur in particular is not just unsurpassed it's also unrivaled.

Mr pillay, tomorrow Tuesday the 29th the Manipur assembly will convene for its
Monsoon session for just one day but it's already clear that all 10 Kuki MLAs, two of whom are Minister seven are in fact from the BJP will boycott the session & at least two national newspapers the Hindu & the times of India suggest that even the 10 Naga mp skips the session in which case Beyond meeting constitutional requirements what real purpose does this one day session serve?

GKP:  I don't think it really serves any purpose except to show that one instrument of the administration, the Constitutional, is still alive & kicking nothing more than that.

KT: in fact isn't that a danger that if all 20 Naga & Kuki mlas do not attend
the session it would be an all-mate session & that will deeply underline
how deep & how perhaps irreversible the division in Manipur has become

GKP:  I'm not so sure yet of whether the Naga mlas would not attend the session although two newspapers the Hindu & the times of India have suggested they wanted it if they do I mean it it only sends a political signal of how isolated in one sense the Meiteis are from the rest of the population in Manipur & that would in a sense bring home to the rest of India how deep & perhaps irreversible this divide is becoming well the division is very deep whether it's irreversible I would still wait to see how the developments take place on the various steps which need to be taken by the government & whether they would take those steps

KT: I want very much to talk to you about the steps that need to be taken & I want to talk about those steps in terms of different issues that occur Law & Order the political issues the background issues but before I come to that let me ask you first for your assessment of the way governments both in Delhi & in far have so far handled this crisis what is your assessment of Chief Minister Biren Singh's handling over almost the last four months

GKP:  I think what we have to realize is that there has been a constitutional breakdown the state government has been more shall I say explicit by its absence rather than its presence across all of Manipur including the Meitei dominated areas & to that extent what was mentioned in the Supreme Court I don't have to one of the justices in the Supreme Court itself mentioned there is an apparent Constitution breakdown

KT: In that case should the chief minister be replaced?

GKP:  That is a political decision for the government of India to take & I think with the government's being of the same both BJP governments in center & the state it is unlikely that if they have not taken decisions so far that they would take such a decision or in the futureâ€¦

KT: Although not so recent past Indira Gandhi dismissed in Punjab when they she felt that they were failing to handle the situation visa & that was a congress government dismissed by a
congress prime minister so the president exists & I believe Nero did that in his time as well surely the interest of Manipur should be Paramount not the party interest of the BJP which is why I asked because clearly this is the chief minister whose lost the confidence of the Kuki people that's 16 percent & several newspaper accounts say 15 of his 32 mlas including eight Maite have also publicly expressed a loss of confidence in him so is he an obstacle now

GKP:  I don't think so I don't see the political party in power sees it that way because if they saw it they would then remove him it might happen in the future it's quite possible but at the moment I don't see the government removing him because they feel that he serves a particular political purpose

KT: in fact the home minister in his speech in the Lok Sabha
said he was being retained because he's in quotes cooperating & that was in terms of removing the chief secretary to moving the dtp accepting kuldeep Singh but as a former Home Secretary who clearly puts the interest of Manipur before the politics does cooperating make up for the fact
that he's been incompetent in restoring Law & Order does it make up for the fact that he's unacceptable to 16 of his population & perhaps pretty close to 50 percent of his own MLAs

GKP:  See it's a question of one is the Constitutional propriety & the other is the political aspects & then obviously in this case the political issues have taken priority over constitutional aspects & it's very clear

KT: is that unfortunate in your eyes

GKP: it is unfortunate yes because it sends a wrong signal not just to Manipur it sends a wrong signal to one all the states in India & especially other states in the northeast of India 

KT: so retaining Biren Singh is sending the wrong signal 

GKP:  yes I think I have no doubt about it

KT: let's come to the handling of the situation by the central government in the speech that he made in the Lok Sabha when the no confidence & debate happened the home minister spoke for two hours & he explained the present crisis in terms of an influx of illegal refugees Kuki refugees from Myanmar from 2021. now there's no doubt that is precisely how the might they believed the situation has arisen but the Kuki have a very different explanation did the home minister make a mistake in only giving the explanation from one side rather than from both sides has he ended up perhaps inadvertently making himself look partisan

GKP:  see once you have supported the chief minister & not dismissed the chief minister then you have to follow The Narrative of the chief minister & that is exactly what the Union home minister has done so that was expected because if we had to follow any other narrative then it would mean that he would have to dismiss the chief minister

KT: & this follows from you're saying that retaining Biren Singh sends a wrong message to Manipur therefore the explanation as far as the Kukis are concerned sends the wrong message to them as well yes

GKP:  no doubt about it 

KT: & I presume this is why the Kukis have responded so angrily towards the home minister said in Parliament the list of Kuki organizations who've condemned the home Minister's speech is pretty long it's the Kuki INPI the indigenous tribal leaders Forum the committee on tribal unity & all 10 Kuki mlas including seven who are from the home Minister's own BJP party doesn't this mean that at the time when the home minister needed to reconcile the Kuki & the Meitei & therefore reach out to the Kuki he's ended up offending & annoying them instead

GKP:  well that is what uh I think the strategy was so I don't uh you know find any uh anything new this has been the strategy of the BJP & therefore it just he's just following that line 

KT:  can you explain that further Mr Pilai you believe the strategy of the BJP is to side with the Meitei & push the Kuki aside 

GKP:  well that's what they've done in in actual practice that's what they've done so it's it's something unfortunate what it's happened & the consequences are there which we have seen & now we have in one sense to pick up the pieces & see where did we take them forward 

KT: You are saying something very important & I'm only repeat but you're actually saying the government of India has taken sides in the Meitei Kuki conflict & it's taken the side of the Meitei yes

GKP:  no doubt about it 

KT: this is truly unfortunate isn't it 

GKP:  it's unfortunate but that's politics today

KT: if you had been home secretary & you saw this happening what would you have said to the home minister 

GKP:  No I think first most important thing is that you have to maintain Law & Order & if you find that the state government because Law & Order is the state subject if they are unable to maintain that then I think you have to take what action follows from that you're suggesting that if you were home secretary & the law & order was not under control it was said to the home minister dispense with your chief minister yes I think if he could not control the situation & the Law & Order situation went out of control as it went & you had a complete breakdown of Law & Order then I think you really need in one sense to have dismissed the chief minister because that I think was you could you don't have to impose president's rule but you have to get could get have got rid of him & brought in somebody else who you could try & if he still failed then the only other option is President's rule 

KT:  so I'll sum up this which you're saying two very important one that's a strategy to be is using in Manipur which is to take sides with the Meitei against the Kuki is the wrong strategy it's unfortunate & secondly retaining experiencing is Chief Minister which follows from that strategy is another terrible mistake yes it is I think in the long term it's a mistake let's come to the prime minister's handling for 79 days he refused to speak in public about money but not a single syllable thereafter if you count up the occasions when he's spoken about Manipur it comes to a total of under 10 minutes which means in nearly four months the prime minister of India has spent less than 10 minutes speaking about one of the worst crises India faces as a former Home Secretary what do you make of that I think the Prime Minister has left it to the home minister to take a call

GKP:  I think this is one it's a it's again a decision it's a decision that he has taken he thinks the home minister is handling it & he doesn't want to interfere with what the home minister is doing therefore he's kept his shall I say minimal uh approach rather than intervene directly

KT: given the seriousness of the crisis on the fact that it's carried on four months was the Prime Minister right to leave this entirely to the home minister 

GKP:  Itâ€™s a difficult call for me to make it's a it's a prime minister as of India he takes the call he's I think politically very astute so he's taken the call I think very deliberately & very in a measured way so we'll have to see how things pan out in the months to come to see whether that call was right or wrong

KT: earlier when we were talking about the home minister you said he has consciously put politics BJP politics ahead of India's constitutional requirements that it seems is also true of Mr Modi

GKP:  see let's let's see how things it's already the matter is before The Supreme Court issues which are coming I think we'll see how how it pans out

Kt: practically everyone I've spoken to in Manipur & in the last four months I think I've done about 30 31 interviews whether these guests were Meitei Kuki Meiteis, they've all said they feel let down by the Prime Minister many have said they think the Prime Minister has done their back on them one of them even said to me we can't even see the prime minister's then are people in Manipur justified in feeding & thinking like this 

GKP:  see I think you are in a state you are trying to make depending on the Prime Minister for trying to solve all your local problems your local problems have to be solved at the local level & I think you have if you cannot expect the prime minister to solve the problem uh especially as complex & complicated just by the Prime Minister intervening it's it's a matter which you have to solve yourself & I think if you are not able to solve it there are other constitutional remedies which of course had not been taken but you have to solve the problem by discussion & dialogue among the groups in Manipur itself 

KT: my last question about the Prime Minister many people say many people in Manipur that he's not just the most popular person in the country he's by far the most powerful what he to take an initiative for he to fly in for a day were he to invite Civil Society organizations to meet him he would give a message that he personally cares & that would encourage people to talk perhaps to reconcile that initiative needed to be taken by him they say how do you respond to that 

GKP:  I think if any prime minister when I said in a situation of this nature needs to reach out to the people because they are all his uh he's a prime minister of all of India & therefore he needs to reach out uh at the earliest when the situation unless as a unless there is you know the intelligence briefings & the other reports which is getting are totally different in which case there's another that's another issue but if the reports are what has come out in the newspapers & has come out through the discussions that you've brought out in some of your interviews as well as the reports of people who have gone there of different parties & different makes it shows a real issue possibly unheard of in post-independence India & I think the Prime Minister would have been well advised to have intervened personally & then see where it goes from there

KT: so you're saying the Prime Minister needed to reach out in the early stages

GKP:  yes at least I think after the after the Union Home Minister's visit ah which is good the Union home minister is spending three days in Manipur is unheard of in any uh laundered situation in the country Post Independent India when that didn't work I think the Prime Minister should have stepped in right calling people to him or by visiting Manipur he could have visited Manipur he could have called people across anyway just the fact that the prime minister is concerned about the situation would have made a tremendous difference because people of the Northeast whether it's Meitei whether it's Kukis whether it's Zomis Paites & so on all of them are the human touch is very very critical for them that somebody cares & it would make a tremendous impact

KT:  by failing to reach out by failing to give that human touch to use your words that somebody cares & let's be honest Mr Modi is very good at doing it when he wants to has he in the case of Manipur been irresponsible

GKP:  I would say you see it's a call that he made the wrong call it's a call that that's for him to take because he said he would have left it to the Union home minister to take the decision he may have felt that his interfering would undermine the Union Home Minister's position any any I mean any number of reasons they could be uh & he thought of felt that his in his uh interference at the early stages uh may have been wrong how I personally feel that his intervention would have had a very salutary effect on the situation but that is my my view others may feel different 

KT: absolutely so in your personal opinion he took the wrong call 

GKP:  in my personal opinion he should have reached out to the people in Manipur even perhaps visited Manipur or at least he should have called everybody over at least the least he could have done was to call everybody over to Delhi for talks in the first week or 10 days

KT:  let's now with this in the background come to steps that are necessary to tackle the problem & let's start with the law & order issue because I imagine that's the most immediate concern if the hormone is true to pick up the phone & say Gopal no one knows the Northeast better than you no one understands Manipur better than you what is your advice to me with regard to tackling Law & Order what would you say 

GKP:  well first I think is you have to what shall I say reduce the number of arms with the civilian population I think the number one priority would be in terms of the law & order I'll come to the relief Rehabilitation separately is the recovery of the 4000 odd weapons which are looted from the police armories you can't have three thousand four thousand arms floating around in the civilian population & expect situation to calm down so that is one number one priorityâ€¦

KT: I imagine that the police & the security advisors are doing their best to try & recover the weapon what is it that they should be doing that clearly they haven't done that would recover weapons quickly 

GKP:  see two things as I put it one I think every single officer in charge of the armories from where it is looted should have been first dismissed from service pure dereliction of Duty it's not it's on this is the first time it's happening in this sort of case second to a large extent people know who's who dams who with whom they are & you should by now have been raiding houses across Manipur to recover These Arms which is not happened & you put drop boxes I mean it's the most ridiculous a situation that after you loot arms are looted you put drop boxes in different parts expect the people who have looted the arms to come & drop the weapons in that is one aspect second I think you have to start slowly initially yesâ€¦

KT: can I interrupt that point before you come to Second aspect a corollary of what you said that people are aware who's got the arms & they should have been reading their houses if they haven't done that & they know who's got the arms then there's a sense in which they're quite happy for them to keep the arms 

GKP: yes which which is why you're not seeing these raids I mean if if I was the DGP of Manipur even if not the old the new dgp has come in if I was the SP in imphal or Churachandpur & so on my first priority would be to recover these weapons these are police weapons so identifiable then the numbers are there & so on & so forth you can you should be raiding houses to recover these 

KT: & if you don't raid the houses Simplicity or at least acceptance that they're part of weapons & we don't mind them having the weapons 

GKP: yes definitely there's no doubt about it because by now if you three months has gone by more than three months have gone if you haven't been reading those to get the weapons back that's a I mean that is one key aspect for controlling the uh launder the situation bringing the violence down come to the second I interrupted you please come to the second the the second aspect in terms of which is the issue of filing these cases which are now of course some cases with the Supreme Court Etc the those cases which will go to Assam cases which are within itself opening up of you have to you have to open up supply lines because you if you block supply lens whether it's by the Meiteis or buy the Kukis Etc it's not good & 

KT: so forcibly those highways must be clear of blockades

GKP:  the highways must be cleared of blockades you can have I think initially you still need possibly for the next six months you still need the buffer zones as still the situation the violence comes down Etc couple of steps they have taken which I have seen which I'll mention partly Also earlier like they posted some tribal officers to the hill districts who have now all India service officers which gives some confidence to the people that okay we've got people whom we know we we are we can trust them they have come to do you need also to get what I what I call as start now of course CBI has taken over some cases but there are other cases which people & like yesterday you saw three houses burned down which is what you are trying you're trying to basically send a message to the Kukis & the zombies we are not welcome back three months have gone by we've half burnt your house now we have you know completely burning down your houses so message don't even think of coming back though personally I think none of them will come back but that's another issue so again two two three weapons looted from residents of some director health or something I mean you can't allow this sort of slackness somebody has to be held responsible which is why I said dismiss the officers & they are both both in the hill districts & in the valley none of them have been dismissed so far not not one so moment you dismiss it you are sending a signal this will not be tolerated at least the next time somebody comes to lutein Armory people will open fire I mean it's you just can't allow that to happen 

KT: you know as I hear you speak the things you are suggesting are obvious there are things that should have been done immediately & yet they haven't been done what does that tell us about the attitude & performance of a whole lot of function is not just the chief minister but I'm not excluding it but the DGP the security advisor the SPs the whole administration of State

GKP: a totally unprofessional I I you want to put it I would even say incompetent because if 4000 weapons have been looted & by now you haven't been doing raids I mean you saw I mean cases when rights take place & so on & so forth first thing that you do if there's weapons have been used by anybody else people read how is it see people have to the civilians have to feel a little bit uncomfortable that this will not be therefore the next time they try to do this they will be second thoughts whereas if they feel that nothing is going to happen to them in fact by failing to read you're giving them cut blush or encourage them to carry on yeah you're telling them that government has actually told you keep the arms

KT: are there other steps that you would advise to the home minister if hearings you up to tackle Law & Order one of them is get back the weapons raid if need be the second is file the case is prosecute them are there other steps in terms of Law & Order 

GKP: see these are the these are the first steps then you start the second process of what I call as giving the relief Rehabilitation & competition part of it which is not but it is equally important because ah from the relief camps itself & stories that both sides the relief camps youngsters & all are going now into what you call as you know Village Defense Forces & so on & so forth so if you don't give confidence to the youngsters that you are to go & study in the school or you are providing some online education & so on within the relief camps itself but then your first priority is to go & get arms training from civilians to protect your own villages that's a failure of the state because the state is supposed to protect the citizens you don't expect the citizens to take arms to protect themselves

KT: people like harshmander who visited with his karma people from the church who are present including Meitei people in the valley all tell me that the majority of the relief is being provided in the camps not by the state but by civil solidarity groups by the church or by my table in other words the state has opted out of doing what it should be doing

GKP: Yes I think that that has been one absence you there are two two three things the state can do the state has a limited capacity I mean Manipur government is not a it's not like you know you would find say Maharashtra or Karnataka or a Delhi government Etc where you know the capacity of the state is limited it's a small state a small number of offices etcetera a very large community organizations are there so it's it's all right that the community organizations come forward but the state must provide money but provide the say like for housing the prefabric housing they must be able to provide the doctors from the government hospitals & so on because most of the hospitals are the medical colleges and so on they should be able to provide other clothing & so on & so forth uh the relief & compensation which would have been expected from a state ah has not come & it's a it's actually a tribute to the strength of community organizations in Manipur both Maite as well as the Christian organizations that they have been able to get in fact we have a an IAS officer in Manipur Uh current Meitei officer who has actually reached out to the IIs Community through his batchmates & money has actually flowed from our groups WhatsApp groups to his NGO which is actuallyâ€¦

KT: but that is an individual taking an initiative not the stateâ€¦

GKP: state rather than the stateâ€¦

KT: but in fact you mentioned the need for Doctors Medical Care you mentioned the need for money newspaper reports when I'm going entirely by them suggest very little of the money that promised has actually reached people whether it's up in the hills whether it's down in the valley & as far as the Kuki are concerned in the Hills there is a real crisis of medical treatment doctors are absent medicine supplies are absent they're having to travel in some instances to nagaland or Assam & some reports suggest that people who are critically ill have died

GKP: yes I think my my information itself tells me that the number of people who have died in these camps has crossed 50. So when you say that 100 & some odd people were killed in the rights you almost got another 35 to 40 percent people have died post riots in the camps for out of various illnessesâ€¦

KT: this is because of the inefficiency or incompetence of the state Administration

GKP: you see not being able to provide the adequate Health in fact I would have expected even from the government of India that they should have started Health Facilities from Modern Age to Medical sciences & so on so forth doctors from various places should have been sent 30 40 doctors should have been sent for by rotation for a month two months to many of these relief camps just to provide the basic health Facilities

KT: not only have they not been sent by the government of India it seems it hasn't even occurred to the government of India that this is needed to do

GKP: No, they are aware. I think the uh union health home minister had promised that 50 Medical Teams would be sent

KT: Absolutely, when he was there he made it but they havenâ€™t gone

GKP: They havenâ€™t gone.

KT: He made a promise & even three months later has failed to fulfill it 

GKP: so that is what that is why the condition in the camps are so poor & many of them are & now of course slowly the prefabricated houses because the Supreme Court panel has you know pointed out the total inadequacy of what has been provided I expect that things to improve now but this is something which should have been done in the first 15 30 days

KT: we're coming to the end of what I call the first section which is restoring Law & Order relief & Rehabilitation you've painted you which is deeply depressing the essential steps to resolve the order are obvious but they're not being taken who knows when they will be taken the steps for Relief & Rehabilitation are obvious they are not being taken with the exception of housing nothing else is really happening so when will we have a restoration of Law & Order when will people be given the relief & Rehabilitation it doesn't look as if there's an end point inside 

GKP: yeah I expect that uh see it is unfortunate because again it's a failure of the government that I expect that the Supreme Court panel has now given its report they have pointed out the inadequacies ETC that has been now been communicated to the state governments & I think next week the response of the state government & the central government will come what have you done I expect that again the state government & central government will to avoid being criticized by the Supreme Court will say that we are rushing some equipments some doctors & so on & so forth to show that uh that are thereâ€¦

KT: that's just face saving..

GKP: thatâ€™s face saving because it should have been done much much before this because 

KT: so we failed as a state in restoring Law & Order & relief & Rehabilitation

GKP: yes we have I think we've see we've had riots uh you know 100 people uh 50 000 is not something which is people in India the size of India we have not faced before but in all cases which has happened whether it's in whether it's in up whether it's in Bihar whether it's in Kerala whether it's States responded very quickly in any riot any riot situation the state responds very quickly & if you don't respond quickly it's a real failure that's where the administration also officers are responsible 

KT: this is where Manipur is a clear outlier

GKP: outlier

KT: we haven't responded quickly in fact we know what we should be doing & we're not doing it. it's very hard to move further but academically I will I imagine side by side with tackling Law & Order which as you pointed out is being done ineffectively if it's being done at all the government also needs to turn its attention to the very difficult intractable political issues are the talks that are happening with the COCOMI on the one hand from the Meitei site & with the ITLF from the Kuki side the right way of tackling this political issue or should the government be reaching out through Civil Society groups & perhaps through highly regarded individuals who both sides respect like for example ratan's hair

GKP: see the government has started I think to to an extent that fact that the dialogues have started even though it's still with one party one party rather than everybody sitting across the table which goes that hasn't that stage hasn't yet come because of the acute uh mistrust between the communities the process has started I think the steps on the Law & Order which I mentioned earlier the steps on the relief Rehabilitation compensation the competition so far has been very inadequate people have lost I mean some in some places crores of rupees & you are then saying I'll give you three lakhs five lakhs which are still not been given so this whole issue of assessing what has been the Damage Done uh finding out who are the people Etc this is something which should have been done still not done but let us assume that those are done these are all steps as part of what I call as the background to the political process which is in one sense at the moment they're talking of separate Administration I still put it as if you are looking at the territory Integrity of Manipur being preserved you are looking at it's a greater autonomy uh whether it's a six schedule status whether it's uh something more it's these are still I put it as one two years down the line because the Manipur issue of autonomy to the hills is also linked to the naga P stocks so uh since the Naga peace talks have also stalled in a little bit in a sense you can't have a solution for Kukis & this thing without keeping the nagas issue also so I expect that that is a issue of two or three years before that will take but in the meantime you can do a number of steps which are which are say getting District administration functional once more fully so you have now a situation where you have a total shall I say of course I think we have to be very clear that not all of Manipur is affected most of the Naga Hill districts like rule Tamenglong senapati Etc no problem at all absolute material officers are working there Naga officers are working their Kuki officers are working there there is no problem so you've got 30 30 percent of that areas all those areas which are shall I say normal Administration is functioning but in other areas like children you've got now Administration which lot of officers are missing because if they were Meiteis they've left if they were Kuki officers from you know they've left them & they are Visa so get maybe in the initial stages empowering Deputy commissioners to fill up vacancies on a temporary basis for a one year period by use by hiring local people to fill up the vacancies in say the primary health centers in The District Health in the district hospitals in schools & so on so that uh of a modicum of Administration is restored & people can go about that normal lives 

KT: what you're suggesting as you said sounds so obvious why is it not being done

GKP: I really don't know though I must say that in the first instance last week they start just started posting on their service travel officers to the hill districts so the three or four officers have been posted I mean the first steps maybe they are starting to realize that Uh

KT: tell me something there are so many things that need to be done in terms of restoring Law & Order Rehabilitation getting the administration functioning empowering District magistrates so that they can temporarily appoint people & you've made it seem so simple & obvious I'm astounded it's not happening but leave that aside should the chief minister be removed to facilitate all of this happening is he an obstacle is that why it's not happening since 

GKP: I haven't talked to the chief minister or you know some of the people in the administration it's difficult to say but I would have expected that from the Union Home Ministry because the home Ministry mha has a very special relationship with states in the Northeast historical uh it's always been the mabab figure of so I would have expected the ministry of Home Affairs to have taken far more uh initiative you know when I was just not East by now the joint secretary Northeast would have been you know camping in imphal & making sure all these things are done I take it he's not doing that we've never heard of him have you heard of The Joint secretary Northeast so that's that's what is really the problem that you need people half a dozen central government officers should have actually been camping in imphal the health secretary The Joint secretary Health The Joint secretary in education in school education & so onwards should have been camping in imphal & issuing orders one two three four start gettingâ€¦

KT: You know the picture youâ€™re painting becomes even more worrisome Mr Pillai not only has the administration in imphal collapsed there seems that the administration in Delhi which technically should know what's required is not doing it it's for some reason or the other it's not acting none of these joint secretaries have gone there none of them have camped none of them have taken the initiative 

GKP: yeah very unfortunate, very unfortunate

KT: This in a sense makes my next question irrelevant but given that it is difficult for a BJP government to dismiss a BJP chief minister should president's rule be imposed where you don't dismiss the chief minister but you just take over charge yourself or would that be no use yeah it's a

GKP: it's a politically call which they have to decide that which means that you are shall I say you are unhappy with what the chief minister is doing but if you are happy with what the chief minister is doing then what happens & the other problem with president's rule is then Delhi would be directly Responsibleâ€¦

KT: & its failure would be immediately obvious there wouldn't be a buffer in between any longerâ€¦

GKP: that is true & definitely that is why I said all these things have to take place simultaneously across different agencies all Ministries for the government of India because you have a state huge All State crisis & therefore all all departments at least key departments which are you know health education water supply you know because there's no water supply in many of the relief camps & so on so all these are should be now Center has to push it & this is something that they should have done in the first 30 days they haven't done it they need to do it because that inspires confidence among the people that the state & the central government cares it is very important especially for the people of the Northeast to feel that the state government & the central government cares about them & that is very very they are very emotional people & unless you approach them emotionally you will never be able to you know win their confidence

KT: at the time when the message that's needed is we care we will reach out we will help you the message that's going both from imphal where the government has collapsed effectively & dairy where the government seems to be indifferent & not bothering is actually carry on As You Are we don't care do what you want you know this is why I think people in Manipur feel let's not put in terms of the PM the system has done its back on them whether it's an Empire or daily they've been forgotten

GKP: yeah that is that's the general feeling all sides including the matches have you ever come across some no I this is this is unique when things are so obvious we are not even looking at the other aspects of you know could this situation have been anticipated were there warning signs because there's been clashes pre-may & so on so we're not even looking at those issues which will come which I hope you know as things calm down & so on people will start to write & but I think & there are still many other issues which are still be which I mentioned are the background issues which are still the refugee issue the issue of the illegal drug trade the issue of forest rights in the forest conservation which now again..

KT: Let me dig those up one by one, but before I do I'll point out something that you hinted at because it will Intrigue the order clearly you believe there were signs before the third of May that the problem was lurking under the surface that it needed attention & care at that warning sign was ignored

GKP: yes I think the signs were there they were they were small clashes there were
small protests there was even you know the issue of you know when the chief Minister's functions
which he was supposed to go to Churachandpur where there was his you know the the ground on
which he was that whatever the structure the shamiana & all this got burned
down Etc this warning signs were all there it's it's a question of how you uh put it
together but that is a that's a separateâ€¦

KT: so there was inefficiency or incompetence or even irresponsibility in
ignoring these warning signs it was there it's all all it was not that it was not there & I imagine these are
warning signs that not only were ignored in infant they were warning signs that sort of struck warning bills in Delhi
but those warning Bells didn't ring here either 

GKP: yes I don't think so because by now otherwise you should have had you
know you would have deployed another 50 companies of crpf before this whole thing happened saying that we anticipate
things it's going to blow up 

KT: so the failure of the Indians system both at Manipur & dead is not just in terms of
handling & responding to the crisis post made her it's also failing to heed warning signs that were ringing and
which should have been paid attention to it's a it's a much longer in course history of failure 

GKP: yes I think the signs were there now you may say that uh how you how you could have reacted to
those signs is different but they were definitely there & I I don't see
any sort of precautionary steps taken either as a state or the central level
to handle those warning signs if they were
they are not been disclosed publicly but the warning signs are there I've talked
to people in the administration in Manipur I've talked to people in the armed forces & so on so everybody says the warning signs were there 

KT: everyone saw that everyone knew they were born in science no one acted liked it then you can only blame yourself let's come to the background issues let's go through them one by one first I'll take up the issues raised by the Meitei then I'll come to the issues raised by the Kuki just for Simplicity the Meitei believe that the Kuki are involved in puppy cultivation & in illegal drug trade what we know from the interview the Samo Jam rinda has given me & she's given it also to news the truth that in fact she Elders that the chief minister has been protecting a drug lord who is a BJP functionary & his wife too she allergies is involved so is this charge made by the Meitei against the Kuki pointing fingers only one direction or are they all involved in it

GKP: I think everybody is involved there's no I mean it's it's been there in the past the drugs both within Manipur as well as the money it's coming Manipur is a history of drug problems from starting from HIV you know when & then the whole Community got together to you know sort of tackle that so it's it's something which is there uh I don't think it's everybody is everybody is involved it's a it's a fact & how they're going to tackle it is I think it's an aquatic control Bureau the enforcement directorate all these people are now to see you know the pmla & so on money laundering Etc because it's big money it's a poppy cultivation the cultivation by the farmers is a what maybe five percent of the total drug trade so ah the public cultivation itself is small but there is a large inflow of drugs & the chemicals coming up from across & it's partly because again we don't we're not we don't realize because mainstream media in India has not covered a Civil War which is going on in Myanmar I mean they've been you know we've had big once in 1960s you know the an air raid on isol that's big headlines that used against their own citizens the Myanmar government is bombing away left right & center & therefore you are going to have these refugees coming in to India & I think it is very important for government of India to have if not a refugee policy at least keep a complete tab on who is coming across the border put them into a refugee campusâ€¦

KT: How serious is the influx of illegal Kuki refugees all the newspaper reports I've read suggest that survey is done by the Manipur government put the numbers that entered Manipur under three thousand something like 45 000 have gone to Mizoram how worrying is an influx of 3000 or is it being exaggerated to point fingers

GKP: see one since the actual this thing has not been done & I would be uh skeptical about the numbers I think the figures in mizoram is taking more than 45 000 Etc uh maybe here 3000 is slightly on the slower side it may be higher maybe 10 000 maybe maybe more but these are refugees see nobody likes to leave his village & come across in just carrying whatever is on the back of their head to to another place unless Dire Straits On The Other Side so it is important for you to say that these are refugees like when you know the Bangladesh they had a problem in East Pakistan & so on 10 million 10 million so we said there's a problem the refugee camps set up your document you document them you fingerprint them you photograph them you do all the all that you want & they remain as documented refugees 

KT: you're saying these people who've come whether they're three four five or ten thousand they're refugees they are fleeing from Terror in Myanmar obviously at some point they want to go back to their home but they are not people who've come to make a living forever in India there is a distinction to be made between refugees from militant Myanmar Terror & people who have come to make a home in India they're the first not the second 

GKP: yes & therefore once once you document these refugees the document he then never becomes an illegal migrant because he always remains a refugee then you have to take up with the government of Myanmar send them back at some point of time when situation isâ€¦

KT: but something else flows from what you're saying I'm talking now both about what you said earlier about the poppy trade & also about these refugees in both cases the finger has been pointed almost interviews makes that clear the involvement on the Meitei side goes all the way to the Chief Minister & again you are saying as regards these refugees they're not coming to permanently settle they are fleeing for fear of their life & they want to go back one day again the finger is pointed to the Kuki & said you're deliberately changing the demography they're not

GKP: I don't think the demography will change we don't have we don't see that numbers yet but remember I I think we all the time we're talking of Kukis the Kukis there's also zombies their chins all are indifferent they are different I mean we look at it the Kuki is not the same as the zoo & The Chins they fought you know in the late 90s the Kukis & the Pie Face they had a huge fight for you know thousands were killed so uh we have to see that different ethnic tribes across from across the border are coming whether some of them are also involved in the drug trade it's a matter for it's open & if I if I am coming here & I am you don't look I am not shall I say not put in a refugee camp where I'm housed as a U.N High Commissioner for refugees they give you a refugee status stamp etc etc then what your your own your own & then when you run your own I would not be surprised if some of them are also involved in this illegal drug State because they will then they have to survive

KT: in other words the administration of the system needs to respond more effectively to this to ensure that refugees remain Refugee refugees yes & this is again another area where the state Administration has failed 

GKP: yeah I think we've see even in mizoram refugees some of them are housed in camps some of them are housed in the with individual families because they're you know their relatives their chins their communities same places & so on but the government of India has not given a single pie to the mizoram government to help in the Mizoram government are saying these are the refugees who have come across we got the names we've got this thing we give you all we have we are providing funds from our state budget help us with some money And

KT: the major on government ask for 10 crore which is eventually after two months delay but another aspect of that is there are some 14 000 manipuri refugees in mizoram & the Manipur government has done nothing whatsoever to help them I mean it could have sent money to mizoram to help them those people are surviving on either meso government largest Civil Society charity the third background factor is this charge made against the Kuki about encroaching on Forest life how accurate is it or is it a misunderstanding as a Kuki claim of the slash & burn style of cultivation

GKP: see you have it's complete it's a complicated issue because you're looking at the hill areas are by & large Forest areas they've been they've been doing slash & burn for us you also have the Manipur I mean the forest conservation act you have Forest rights for tribals who have been there that's one aspect of what they do there is now also forests which are to be preserved as forests & not to be slash & burn also you've now have I've yet to examine the implications of the New Forest conservation act which is passed in Parliament in their previous session where the government has got the right to say this is a forest & this is not a forest so there is some areas on which there is a little bit of a gray area those have not yet got implemented again when the Manipur government starts to implement the New Forest act & declare a particular area as non-forest & so on & so forth it will create

KT: absolutely  but this is the Manipur government again wrongly pointing fingers at the Kuki & claiming they're encroaching when in fact the government doesn't understand the style of cultivation the Kukis is there a mistake being made in pointing a finger at them see it's both I think you have to look at the fact that there is one slash & burn cultivation which which is normal then you have also some encroachment which is taking place people encroach every anywhere I mean it's across the world anywhere slight any public area is available it's..

KT: so you're suggesting that the charge of encroachment may not be wrong but it's being exaggerated 

GKP: I think it's been exaggerated, but I would I would be surprised if there was not some encroachment into Forest 

KT: that's human nature 

GKP: human nature 

KT: so on
the three background issues we've discussed refugees involvement in the drug treatment poppy cultivation encroachment in Forest areas there is an element of exaggeration when the finger is pointed uniquely & exclusively with the Kuki both sides are involved in the drug trade the refugees are actually refugees they're not coming to change the demography is able to go back that needs to be understood & as regards encroachment there is some encroachment happening but it's being exaggerated is that correct yes I think that's the actual ground situation let's then come to the that's not perhaps the last part of this interview from the Meitei point of view the real concern is what they call The Landing barrels & they think it should be resolved in terms of giving them scheduled tribe status do you believe given your understanding of Manipur & his complexities that scheduled tribe status is the right way of addressing the land the ballot so are there other ways that could be equally efficacious but less controversial

GKP: yes I think so I don't think even among the Matthews there was earlier I think it was almost 70 percent of the Meiteis didn't want ST status now they say it's come 50 50 after his clashes & so on land is a is an issue no doubt about it uh & the metis have a genuine uh represent genuine grievance if I want to if I may put it that way primarily again psychologically that you know people from the hills can buy land in the valley but you can't buy land in the hills & I think this is where I think uh political statesmanship from both sides is involved there is a certain the land hunger is there for everybody very thickly populated here less populated because you also have Forest areas so ah the you can't it's not Apple to Apple so you need some element of political compromise by which the Meiteis also can have some access to land in the hill areas for certain purposes you can have a restriction you can say ceiling will be five percent or ten percent of the total area for ABC purposes Etc some of it they've been discussions in the past with the Hill area Council in terms of for industrial purposes for setting up industrial parks in the hill areas for the mateys who come & settle down who are working government servants & so on because they are Manipur Public Service Commission they get recruited then you can get posted to the Hills you might marry somebody there & you want to settle down there then you should be allowed not say that I'm not a person & not be out..

KT: That permission from Hill councils is already available but it I gather is given very grudgingly

GKP: yeah it's given tragically it's very little it's uh

KT: but you say that this is an issue the land imbalance that with the political initiative taken by sensible farsighted politicians can be very easily reserved yes I think it needs to if people have to realize that it is an issue you have to realize that

GKP: the Meiteis have a problem don't brush it aside the carpet no no the hills are as we are not going to give you a scent of it therefore you can't I think you can't take that attitude

KT: but the corollary you're saying this can be resolved without necessarily giving the Meitei schedule tribe status yes in other words you need a far-sighted politician who takes the initiative & that means someone has to stick their neck out because that's what you do when you take a Ministry isn't it yeah

GKP: I think a lot of Meiteis is uh responsible citizens also say that we are not scheduled tribes & as it stands in the current definition of where the schedule tribe we are not the schedule tribes uh some of them are vaishnavi brahmins some of them of course looking back to their old indigenous faith in which case they are you know shall have more akin to estimate but today now in the uh context of where they are now in terms of their education their social uh you know lack of anybody nobody discriminates against my thieves in terms of the educational levels all the things which the estate commission would actually look at to see are you I'm missing in that case are missing in their case so it is unlikely that they would get from the ST commission ah ST stages 

KT: but what you are really saying is that we land hunger of them might say can be resolved if a far-sighted politician would take the initiative it doesn't necessarily require schedule tribe stages political division taken by a sensible political politician that's the problem such a politician is missing it doesn't exist on the horizon 

GKP: yeah but you have to also from the other side I think the hill areas also the people must also be a little accommodative if they if they see that little bit of accommodation I think the methyl politicians will also respond positively 

KT: let's come to the last issue the Kuki particularly after the experience of the last almost four months a demanding separate Administration they've made it clear that they cannot live with the Meitei any longer after what's happened & this is a separate Administration means either a separate state or a union territory status now if you were home secretary this is a very tricky demand because if they're given some sort of separate Administration it will fracture Manipur because the nagas immediately would want to join up with nagaland & all that would be left is the imphal valley & on the other hand you can also understand that after what they've gone through the Kuki clearly want some measure of autonomy to be able to safeguard themselves so how would you if your Home Secretary tackle this extremely difficult issue

KT: see I've always been off the view & in fact as JS Northeast there's even a literally an Affidavit of mine in the Manipur assembly saying that government of India is committed to the territorial integrative Manipur I've said that even during the Naga talks & so on said we are not touching that if you are not touching that then issue then Becomes of matter of autonomy um you got the hilarious Council which hasn't really worked because again the state no state government likes to give autonomy it's happened in Assam when you have six scheduled status & even the six schedule areas Bordeaux when we negotiated the Bodo Accord we gave a lot of autonomy but they still feel that because the money is rooted through the state government it's the who controls the money controls everything else so unless there is financial autonomy it becomes very difficult for anybody to feel that I'm really you know autonomous therefore an autonomous Council an autonomous area is fine it can be under the sick schedule I think in the past even Manipur there's been uhâ€¦

KT: but the sixth schedule doesn't apply Manipur 

GKP:  no it can

KT: but it can be implied

GKP: it can be extended to any particular area which the government wants uh in the past Manipur governments have been said this is acceptable but this is something negotiating to be negotiated 

KT: there are reports in the papers that the talks that were happening with the Sioux groups & the home Ministry which then got overtaken when made the third happened we're reaching a sort of conclusion to which reports suggest the Sioux groups were willing to concede that autonomous Hill area councils or autonomous territorial councils perhaps under the sick schedule would be acceptable now the Kuki said that door is closed do you think it can be reopened can this package be sweetened to make the Kuki accepted

GKP:  I think it can be reopened it it's a question of you have to give it a little bit of time I think you have to allow the other processes which I mentioned earlier the step-by-step processes on in terms of the Law & Order & leave this to the last & leave this to the couple of years down the line because I don't think at this stage uh anything forget six schedule forget UT forget a new state Etc will be you know discussed at all right not it's just too early it's too early so that's two three years down the line as I put it 

KT: but you're also suggesting that to make the Hill area councils or the autonomous territorial districts or whatever you call them acceptable you'd have to also apply the sixth schedule of the Constitution so it's a lot closer to the Borderland structure & perhaps in addition give them also some measure of financial autonomy 

GKP: yeah that is those are part which can be negotiated with over a period of I think that I I put it as I think it's about two three years down the line when all other things as I said uh I'm hoping that slowly all the other positive steps will take place & we don't have & this is my great fear we don't have I think for two three months uh I think till November December I think there'll be relative calm but uh there is a lurking fear that you might again end up with another about a burst of violence 

KT: why do you say till November December they become what what is you after that 

GKP: number of issues from one the Supreme Court looking at the whole uh case the Romantic hola issue there are some issues which are taking the poppy cultivation gets harvested in November so nobody wants both sides don't want any anything which might affect the cultivation of puppy so many other so many issues are there at the back of it so uh

KT: if I understand correctly what you're saying is that both sides have an interest in ensuring that the puppy Harvest is not affected both sides have an interest in watching to see how the Supreme Court reacts which is why there will be a sense of relative come to November December your worry is once the puppy Harvest is done & once the Supreme Court has perhaps turned its attention to other matters the situation can flare up again around November December 

GKP: which is why I mentioned that you know the earlier steps like recovery of all looted arms getting the you know Administration in these areas back Etc getting this you know trust where people then feel that I don't have to uh you know you don't have too many uh sporadic issues which you know right keep tension Rising but there is a sort of gradual coming people feel things about go back to critical steps those are critical steps because otherwise if you have three thousand four thousand arms maybe more comes which come in from across the border & so on you are sitting on a Tinder Box which you have to be very careful uh you can always blow up 

KT: but the problem is those critical steps are not happening we've discussed in detail but they're not happening we have to keep our fingers crossed at hope & pray that they do happen

GKP: yes it's very important that they happen if you are looking at the larger long-term interests of Manipur 

KT: one last question there is one obvious sign on the horizon & I want to ask you whether it worries you recent statements issued by the United Naga Council increasingly suggest that the nagas I'm talking about the manipuri nagas are siding with the Meitei against the Kuki & a statement issued by Mr Muiva from Hebron seems to suggest the same thing is they had a potential for a second conflict happening we've already got a Meitei Kuki one could there now be a Kuki Naga one developing as well 

GKP: no I don't think so I I don't think so I think the NSCN IM & what they are really basically is stressing that don't ignore the nagas which is why I said any settlement you have with the Kukis Etc don't leave us out of it because their Naga interests involved both in the autonomy which can be given to the the so-called areas as well as the areas where supposedly Kuki dominance is there but the nagas may say that those are some areas we are we also have influence in those areas so don't count us out we want to be involved in those negotiations which is a fair & I think the whole package of autonomy will come issue with the Naga peace talks in terms of the autonomy for the nagas autonomy for the Kukis & autonomy for the Zomies & so on

KT: what the Naga United council is doing is not spoiling for a fight it's simply putting its car down on the table & saying listen folks don't forget about us right in other words it's making its presence felt it's not actually spoiling for a fight even though they've accused The Kuki of false history & lies but that's just their way of saying don't forget about Us

GKP: I think so & I don't think they will spoil for a fight in fact the Naga should be most worried because in the city of imphal they are the only ones left 

KT: absolutely so my last question everything that we've discussed both in terms of what the government should do but hasn't done whether an imphal o daily & in terms of what they then need to do but which will be difficult & will take time suggest to me that this is not only a very complicated & complex issue but it's intertwined with emotional politics & it will not be easy to solve & it will take years to solve you've talked about two three years but it's possible it could take a Whole Decade 

GKP: yeah it depends on how how fast as we said & we don't have too many setbacks on the route which I mentioned it's because it's it's it's important that we don't have uh those setbacks because these are things which sometimes happen when you ignore I think we've realized now that you cannot ignore warning signs if the warning signs are there now here as I mentioned the warning signs of presence of civilian arms with civilians in thousands I mean if in Delhi we had AK-47 & semi-automatic rifles with 10 000 you know people in Delhi the Delhi police would be extremely worried you know I mean the first thing they would go if they have diluted from Delhi armories they wouldn't have that sleepless night it didn't happen 

KT: so what we're saying is that we have to keep our fingers crossed the things don't fare up things don't deteriorate it could be a sensitive delicate situation for years to come we just have to be very careful about how we handle Manipur 

GKP: yes we have to be very careful how you handle Manipur 

KT: & not only must the government in imphal keep its eyes open & its ears open & respond quickly so must the government in Delhi we can't afford for laxity we can't afford for people diverting their attention

GKP: I don't think we can afford at all I mean it this is something which has both not just domestic implications it has International ramifications yes because it's interpreted as Hindu versus Christian abroad & if the violence of the Civil War in Myanmar goes out of control uh then you can expect refugees uh to like come in bigger numbers like you're seeing in Europe from Africa you you know every time you have in Sudan in Niger in all these countries you have the Civil War all of them finally take a boat & swim across there here this is just a cross they'll come here & those which are on the other side 

KT: yeah in addition they've got kinship because the same tribes are split between Myanmar & India sometimes India Bangladesh as well I thank you for opening our eyes I thank you for the honesty with which you've addressed the situation I hope in particular the government in Delhi is listening to you there's a lot that you said that will benefit them thank you very much indeed 

GKP: thank you hi I'm Karan
