KT: hello and welcome to a special interview for the wire the Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity is one of the reportedly Premier organizations and institutions of Manipur last week its officials were in talks with members of the intelligence Bureau in Delhi to try and find a solution to the crisis in Manipur but at the same time it's reported that the Assam rifles have charged COCOMI with sedition joining me now to talk about COCOMI is its spokesperson you are the spokesman of kokumi whilst in Manipur COCOMI is well known outside Manipur people don't know an awful lot about your organization so let me start by asking you what sort of organization is yours and what is its purpose and intent

AKH: in short COCOMI is a conglomerate of various measures Civil Society organizations of Manipur and we represent not less than 70 other civil society organizations including the students group The Women Fox the mothers organization they made up IB so we represent all those organizations and we worked for the totality or the territorial Integrity of the state of Manipur

KT: do you also represent the kuki community yes in certain terms we do represent not just kuki but every ethnic communities of the state
 
KT: are Kuki organizations Affiliated to you 

AKH: uh at the very first instance there were affiliations right but now now they know after some time they have withdrawn their affiliations because of their own interest 

KT: so at the moment you have no kuki members no kuki Affiliated

AKH: no
 
KT: so then how do you represent them
 
AKH: we represent in representing their interest the purpose of the entire communities that are living and coexisting together so that's how we represent 

KT: You claim that you represent that interest but you don't have kuki membership

AKH: yeah that's because we don't resist them from from taking part in COCOMI but it is their decision to not come in and join 

KT: but at the moment kokumi is entirely comprised of Mait eorganizations Meitei people yes tell me are you considered the premier organization representing meitei interests in Meitei welfare today I know you claim to be a manipuri organization but given that you don't have kukumi membership and only my team membership I'm asking the question in my theater are you the premier organization representing meitei interest meitei welfare

AKH: no not just not exclusively see see let me explain in that part if you say you represent the whole country and if your organizations don't don't have members from Punjab members from South India Tamil Nadu then will it still say that you are not a national interest uh representing the nation it's not like that representations means how do we float our agenda how do we work what is our philosophy what is our idea

KT: Are the Nagas members of your organizations that's 24 percent of manipur's population do you have Naga Affiliated institutions we worked with the Naga people but you don't have them as Affiliated

AKH: I myself work for the nagas cause

KT: But do you have groups of Nagas and institutions that are part of COCOMI 

AKH: yeah there are certain groups

KT: such as can you name them 

AKH: such as the kabui uh this thing the Kabul Union kabui is one of the major Naga ethnic communities 

KT: so you're saying one of the Naga communities is Affiliated to COCOMI

AKH: no we also have other organizers like the one I have the Mao in fall market Coordination Committee there are the Mao people the president of Mao Union I am the convener The Mao Union is the chairman we work together so it's in a different uh you know aspective I'm just asking for clarity yeah yeah Naga groups are part of COCOMI certain groups are part of COCOMI and we coordinate with the United naga councils in certain agendas as well 

KT: so your relationship with the nagas is a closer and better one than the one with the Kukis

AKH: no 

KT: but you have no kuki members 

AKH: yeah but it it's the same we also see before this third May incident we had a meeting with the kuki in pimanipur the president and everyone in our office and we even set a meeting the meeting was supposed to be on 6th of May but this sudden you know eruption of the third May incident has you know something like broken

KT: yeah you continue to have some contact with some Naga institutions not all but some as you said but you have no contact with any kuki Institution

AKH: oh we had we had

KT: which one

AKH: we had the Kuki Inpi 

KT: you still have contact with the Kuki INPI today

AKH: not today but on the first and second week of May 

KT: okay but after the second..

AKH: even the kuki students organization 

KT: after the second week of May 

AKH: no there is no further communication 

KT: Tell me do you have any relationship with Meitei organizations like arambai tengol and Meitei Leepun

AKH: no

KT: none at all 

AKH: no 

KT: how do you view Arambai Tengol & Meitei Leepun?

AKH: we are yet to ascertain because there are only allegations but we are yet to ascertains who are around by 10 goals who are the leaders where do they have their office we have no idea on that but we only come to know through Facebook post that there's one piece called arambai tengo and they even after the I think first or second week of May they again declared Declaration of there is a declaration of dissolving their organizations again and then coming out again so we really don't know


KT: I'm saying this from memory but let me tell you some of the things I know about arambai thank God and separately some things I know about my telephone yeah Rabbi thank God have put our tweets talking about how they have access to money police rifles they've talked in tweets about how they were told by their chief minister to raise the villages and now they've been told not to raise them those are on tweets which are available to anyone to see separately promoting who's the head of my telephone said to me in this studio sitting where you are that he has been giving gun training to people who have guns already he says that in fact the kuki will be wiped out there will be a Civil War in a particular 15 Mile Zone he said in his Facebook that the kuki should be annihilated he said that five days before the troubles began on the 20th of April so how then in the light of this does your organization view Arambai Tengol & Meitei Leepun?

AKH: no and that's their view I don't know because Meitei say in a in a way Meietei is not a community in the first place is a nation you should understand Meitei has its own different philosophy beta is represents different background different philosophy different religious practices so there are other groups and as you have just mentioned the arambai tengo and the material that users mentioned COCOMI has no coordination no communication nothing at all

KT: so you don't support people like Pramot Singh who said on their Facebook let us annihilate..

AKH: no no no 

KT: you don't

AKH: that's not the case yeah

KT: you don't support people from Arambai Tengol who have who claim that they have been told by Biren saying to raze Villages 

AKH: now that's just yet to be ascertain you are just floating up some

KT: quoting their tweets 

AKH: whatever but you we really don't know that 

KT: but what you're saying to me is you're distancing yourself from them 

AKH: yeah yeah you have nothing to do we are also an organization we work in our own line of objective and purpose they must have their owners and now so okay there is no connection at all

KT: let me then sum up this bit of the interview for the audience you are an organization that claims to represent all of panipur not just the meitei yeah unfortunately since the middle of may you don't have any kuki affiliation any longer but you do have some affiliation with some Naga outfits yeah right and secondly you distance yourself from the things that arambai thank God and my telepon has said you don't share those positions about annihilating or raising Villages

AKH: no no no no no 

KT: no that's a clear no?

AKH: yeah no 

KT: okay let's then come to another subject the Indian Express on the 27th of this month reported that on Wednesday and perhaps on Thursday representatives of your organization kokumi and I'm quoting now had a round of talks with an intelligence Bureau official representing the center can you confirm those talks

AKH: no we don't have any official meeting

KT: did you have an unofficial meeting

AKH: no 

KT: you had no meeting at all 

AKH: no

KT: so what are you doing in Delhi at the moment

AKH: we were here for a national press conference coordinating with the Meitei people trying to console them on this issue and we are also meeting some of the political leaders

KT: you know it's very interesting you should say you had no meeting with the intelligence Bureau the homeownist has gone on record to say that he's had 6 runs of meetings with Meitei organizations and separately 6 tons of meetings with Kuki organizations 

AKH: there may be other parts but not with COCOMI in this as you mentioned on 27th

KT: so when the home minister says that he's had six runs in meetings with is not one of them

AKH: not in recent times when we are in Delhi

KT: When You Say Nothing recent times when did you last speak to the home minister

AKH: When he was in imphal 

KT: that was right at the end of May 

AKH: yeah

KT: so since the end of May COCOMI has had no talks with anyone in government 

AKH: no 

KT: at any level

AKH: uh there was one guy from the IB and he invited us for a tea because uh he was here 

KT: so you are now confirming that there was a guy from IB who invited you for tea 

AKH: no no no see he works in IB but we were talking on a personal matter he was inviting me for the tea 

KT: when was this?

AKH: I think two days ago three days 

KT: so two days ago someone from IB invited you for tea?

AKH: yeah

KT: I wanted to talk about

AKH: he's a familiar person he was in imphal for quite some time 

KT: well what did you talk to him about. he sounds like the ideal sort of IB person to start talks what did you talk about 

AKH: that's that's not about the issue we didn't discuss much on issue

KT: but you do confirm that you were invited to tea by an IB official 

AKH: yeah but not a not on official capacity

KT: where did you meet him 

AKH: we meet him here in Delhi 

KT: in his office 

AKH: no 

KT: then 

AKH: in a place his place or somewhere I don't know I forgot the location somewhere

KT: his residence or some secret place 

AKH: yeah it's kind of residence kind of 

KT: or was it a secret house

AKH: no no I we we have no idea on that because he's a non-familiar uh you know he's a non-familiar person because he wasn't a person you don't know you're not familiar with inviting he's a familiar I mean he's a non k-n-o-w-n known person he was in imphal we had a he even speaks manipuri he was there for quite some time 

KT: he sounds like he's an ideal person from IB to start talks 

AKH: no no because we didn't discussion because there isn't any official 

KT: you didn't discuss or won't admit you discussed 

KT: no it's not like that because for sure I am not in the capacity to initiate a talk because...

KT: you are the spokesman of COCOMI

AKH: yeah but we I didn't come with an official mandate but..

KT: I'm not saying that you held the talks did your seniors in COCOMI holder talks

AKH: no nobody I don't have any information

KT: absolutely no don't have information or you don't know

AKH: No because we have to have the information I am part of the executives 

KT: is it possible that talks will help without your knowing 

AKH: no no that's impossible

KT: let me ask you two different questions status

AKH: no it's not about support or not support it's more about why this adult tribe demand has been plotted why we know should it be granted if you know just so tell me should it be granted that's the key show I'm asking you should it be granted no that's up to the government's but you must have a position on it no we don't have no we have no opinion as of now and said we'll try it 

KT: so COCOMI has no position no opinion on the schedule 

AKH: yeah 

KT: You neither supported nor opposite 

AKH: yeah

KT: you're absolutely clear 

AKH: yes we don't even discuss on several tribes in COCOMI's level 

KT: but the point you're saying is you don't support it you don't oppose it either 

AKH: we don't even discuss on this matter in the table of COCOMI

KT: what about the kuki demand supported by all 10 kuki mlas and also Now by kuki inp that they want a separate Administration and now Kuki INPI has made it clear that by separate Administration they mean a separate state I imagine as a manipuri organization you are opposed to that because it would involve the breakup of Manipur 

AKH: yeah

KT: but

are there any grounds on which you could

agree to it 

AKH: no no ground at all 

KT: ever

AKH: no you will never think of any possibility that you could agree to a separate Administration 

AKH: yeah even Heaven Falls it's impossible 

KT: Even If Heaven Falls

AKH: yeah it's impossible 

KT: impossible suppose the home Ministry to come and say to you the trouble in Manipur has gone on for too long the government has failed to quieten and restore peace in order the Army and the paramilitary are not succeeding either the only way to do it is to Grant the kuki separate Administration a separate Union territory what would you say

AKH: the home minister cannot decide everything on Manipur Manipur has its own position Manipur has its own history Manipur has its own conditions so he cannot decide everything on Manipur 

KT: or just a moment in 2019 this government decided everything about Kashmir on its own and it did it by surprise and the kashmiri people were not consulted the same thing could happen to you if the government feels that there is no other way of restoring peace and Harmony that's why I asked the question 

AKH: yeah for that they have to try and take a chance we will also take the same chance to respond in the right way 

KT: but you are saying to me that under no circumstances can you accept separate Administration 

AKH: yeah yeah

KT: okay the Hindu newspaper has reported that Assam rifles filed an fir against COCOMI and specifically against jitendra ningompa if that's how you pronounce his name the convener of COCOMI and you have been accused of suggestion of promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and race and also of defamation as spokesman of COCOMI how do you respond to this fir

AKH: firstly they have to prove that allegations number one that we are having that kind of religious issues and you know citing enemies between the groups and communities they have to prove it and I think Assam rifles is one of the key organizations who are directly or indirectly responsible in this current situation turmoil situation in Manipur 

KT: when you say responsible what are you saying

AKH: because they have committed so many faults 

KT: faults

AKH: yeah 

KT: such as 

AKH: such as when they initiate the 2005 so aggress ceasefire within kuki militants there wasn't any official informations to the state government when they formalize it on 2008 since then they have been working in coordination with the militant kuki militant Narco terrorist groups who are you know actively engaging in all sort of drug trafficking poppy cultivations bringing in of illegal immigrants and they are responsible for taking care of the international boundary

KT: I just want to make clear I've understood you correctly you're saying from 2005 and particularly from 2008 the Assam rifles have been working with siding with what you call kuki Nako terrorist let's leave the kukinaco Terrace out because people dispute whether that's a accurate or even fair description

AKH: Which people are you talking about

KT: The Kuki themselves full stop

AKH: We are telling, COCOMI is teling that

KT: and officially the government of India also doesn't accept the word terrorist as a description of

Kuki so let's leave that out 

AKH: no no, you can't do that

KT: I'm talking about Assam rifles you're accusing the Assam rifles of taking sides

AKH: yeah

KT: you mean that 

AKH: yeah

KT: according to the Hindu on the 10th of July COCOMI and I'm quoting gave a call to people not to surrender weapons is that right did you give such a call

AKH: no we didn't say that what did you say what we said is the the circumstances has made the people not let surrender their weapons 

KT: sounds like the same thing to me 

AKH: no because we are conveying the situation we are not uh what do you say we are not making a call we are conveying the situation

KT: what you're saying is the following we didn't ask people not to surrender weapons we explained why we are not surrendering

KT: you're sure

AKH: yeah that's what asaraf was misquoted because they are desperate now because there are so many allegations on Assam rifles the home minister has been brief on that the home minister himself assured us that some of the Assam rifles...

KT: When did the Home Minister give you this assurance 

AKH: when he was in imphal

KT: but this charge is 10th of July 40 days after you left 

AKH: yes yes because they are desperate now because we have certain inputs that initiative..

KT: You sure this wasn't something the home minister said you two days ago?

AKH: yeah we have certain inputs..

KT: or did the IB guy who invited you for tea said this

AKH: no no it's not really that we don't discuss on that matter 

KT: the Hindu also reports that COCOMI has alleged that a large number of women protesters were assaulted by the Indian army in the moirang area of vishnupur on June the 30th the Army has denied the allegation howconfident are you of this accusation

AKH: we have video evidence of the army molesting 

KT: not molesting they are they are they are beating the protesters and manhandling

KT: what community did the protesters come from 

AKH: Meitei

KT: so you have videos of the local TV channels as all reported National media avoided that news

AKH: which is why I'm asking you because unfortunately we don't have access to local media that operates in Manipur 

AKH: National Media were there but they avoid the news 

KT: but you're saying that you have videos 

AKH: local media already reported 

KT: these are videos from the 30th of June of the army assaulting and beating up yeah women protesters yes in moirang of Bishnupur yes this proof is there with you 


AKH: local media has already reported 

KT: but you've the videos

AKH: it's in the local media's library when you watch the news 

KT: when you go back to imphal I believe you're returning on Monday yeah can you send those videos to us 

AKH: sure

KT: that's the promise yeah yeah sure again according to the Hindu and I'm quoting in a memorandum to the home minister on June 4th COCOMI demanded that the Assam rifles be replaced with any other Central armed police force can you explain why do you want the Assam rifles replaced I've got a hint of it already but can you explain this specifically

AKH: Assam rifles failed to perform their duties properly some rifles is responsible for the Indo Myanmar border management and all this issue of illegal immigrants are because of their lacked in incapacity to control the international borders and Assam rifles is also responsible for all this drug trafficking drugs what you will be surprised over the past five years since 2017 till today the state has already seized and arrested drugs would 7 880 how do you know this it's report from the narcotic Affairs bureaus Manipur police department 

KT: and you're alleging that the Assam rifles is involved 

AKH: not involved but that they fail to uh you know control and seize this trafficking of drugs from across the border over the past 

KT: why would they fail to do something it's so obviously it's a job and it's so obviously wrong if they don't do it why would they fail to do it

AKH: you should ask Assam rifles 

KT: but you're the one who's bringing up the charge no one else

AKH: we are coming up with have we have recovered recently when there was a cabinet subcommittee uh before the you know detection of illegal immigrants it was headed by uh one of the kuki Minister Mr leper hockey and it comes out to our comes out that 2187 illegal immigrants were being left settled inside the Manipur territory must be knowing that because they are in charge of the whole area..

KT: So..

AKH: let me finish let me finish then what happened there are also they have also been allowed to build up proper cottages and houses despite the you know government's Assurance for a shelter home for those illegal immigrants or the refugees and there is also a camp for the VDF in new Gamphazawl area area

KT: you're making two critical charges in
this interview against the Assam rifle first earlier you said they are deliberately siding with the Kuki people and now you're saying they are turning a blind eye to Illegal immigration they're turning a blind eye to Narco terrorism and the smuggling of drugs you're saying three things against 

AKH: them they might not turn Blind Eye but they fail to perform so we want replacement 

KT: well surely failure to perform means they've gone to Blind Eye 

AKH: no they might they might not be able to do that

KT: when you say might not be able to that you mean they're incapable of doing 

AKH: they are not doing because the situation is proving they are not doing 

KT: let me point out something at this moment yeah that should have become apparent to the audience when I first asked you if you represented just the meitei or Manipur as a whole you said Manipur as a whole you said that you represent even the kukis right you said that you have or did have prior to me the third affiliations with them now you've been referring to the kuki community which sounds like narcot terrorists you've been accusing the kuki community of allowing illegal immigrants into Manipur and allowing them to settle there if that is your attitude to the Kuki Community how can you claim you represent them 

AKH: how do you conclude that from what you said no no how do you conclude that we we we blame the whole kuki communities how do you conclude on what pretext

KT: from the way you spoke but your language is what I'm using against you

AKH: what language I'm using 

KT: you call them Narco terrorists

AKH: I call Narco terrorist I call Narco terrorists not the whole Kuki 

KT: Let me point out something to you most
 people who have written knowledge you believe about the drug trade in Manipur say that it is quite possible that some opium plantations or fields are being run by kukis the drug lords are meitei it's being done jointly by both but the drug lords the people who are in charge are Meitei yet you're only pointing the finger at them 

AKH: they should come out they should come out with the facts no doubt certain Meitei peoples are also involved it is have also been mad but you know 

KT: but the key Point let me come to this,m you can't really claim to represent the kukis when none of them are any longer Affiliated to you but that we've talked about more importantly you can't claim to represent them when you seem to refer to them as Narco terrorists as people who give protection to illegal immigrants who've actually been aligned to build houses in Manipur that attitude 

AKH: I think you are you are missing the the the the context of the law of the land you are you are violating the law of the country 

KT: what is the law of the country that's being violated 

AKH: how could you let immigrants do you have any distinction between the foreigners and the citizens

KT: MR Khuraijam, in 1970, 10 million Bangladeshi people they were east Pakistani at the time came across the border and given shelter because there was a problem in East Pakistan there is a major problem in Burma some 40 to 45000 Chin refugees from Burma have short shelter in mizoram right they haven't come there because they want to come there but they're fleeing from the lack of safety in their country similarly 2000 perhaps or maybe four by some counts have come to Manipur because they are fleeing they're not illegal immigrants they're refugees from insecurity and violence in their country 

AKH: can I explain 

KT: of course

AKH: those immigrants who went to mizoram they don't demand for a separate Administration they don't demand for a kuki Homeland they don't talk about bifurcating the state of mizoram but those immigrants who have arrived in Manipur since 1960s they are now floating for a separate kuki Homeland they are distorting the history of Manipur they are you know concocting new new ideas they are generating you know rewriting new histories they are trying to distort the entire Manipur civilization 

KT: Mr Khuraijam

AKH: they don't show any allegiance to the state of Manipur and its idea 

KT: I won't say that's the difference you should understand I won't dispute what you are saying because I use it instead to disprove what you claimed earlier that you'd represent all Manipuris including kukis now you are saying that people who are cooking and have been in Manipur from the 1960s right are in fact illegal immigrants from the 1960s 

AKH: See there are also Kukis who have come in from 1840s

KT: how can you represent the Kukis if this is the attitude of the COCOMI spokesman 

AKH: it should be very it should be very clear it should be it should be based on facts I cannot simply have a very you know sweet tongue with a with a with a very you know 

KT: Sir, sir, sir

AKH: Let me complete this. Let me complete my position.

KT: Go ahead. Go ahead. 

AKH: Number one you should understand there

are three types of Kuki migrations that happen in Manipur the first settlement was in the 1840s second comes where from 1960s they have been given Refugee status and let them say

KT: can I interrupt 

AKH: no

KT: let me come on I have to interrupt for one reason in Manipur were actually invited by your Maharaja because he wanted a protection against the Burmese that's there they were deliberately brought in by the Maharaja and settled as a protection and a buffer between Manipur the state that he ruled and the Burmese because of the invasions from the Burmese so what happened 

AKH: that that's correct okay in a sense..

KT: so that's not illegal immigration

AKH: Who told.. you are concluding on so many things without even you know it's been half cooked you're concluding when it's even half cooked come on the 1840s kuki they have been naturalized by the ruler as users said they are called native Kuki no doubt they are Khongsai not Kuki to be precise they are known as Khongsai in Manipur in 1960s they are many of the other you know similar communities arrived in Manipur because of the military yunta all those things there we given the refugee status and they've been allowed to settle in Manipur as a refugees got my point the third phase is after 2005 the Assam rifles signing ceasefire with the militant groups and the enhancement of further bringing in of illegal immigrants so now what happens the first Native uh you know the settlers the kuki or the konsai generally which are majority of them are Vaiphei they have no diction no issue with the you know 

KT: and the others do 

AKH: and the others do okay they fail to prove their allegiance they started demanding for a Homeland so that's the issue 

KT: I will not dispute the facts of what you're saying I cannot dispute the facts I'm not saying they're correct I just don't know that bit of Kuki history I did know that by the way that the first kuki people who were brought in by the Maharaja were brought them they were naturalized no issue without I will do that is point out once again for a second time that this attitude to the kukis May is it very hard to believe that COCOMI can actually represent them increasingly as I hear you speak you sound like a meitei organization claiming to be an old manipuri one but you sound very much like a voice of the meitei not a voice of the whole state but let's leave and come to my last issue it's a charge or an allegation made in an interview to me on Thursday but the General Secretary of the kuki People's Alliance Wilson it's a party that has two mlas in the manipuri assembly it's a party that was an ally of birencing until the beginning of May when they broke their relationship in an interview to me on Thursday he said that at common lock on the 13th and 14th of June when Meitei and kuki combatants clashed Mr Hangsing estimates that 200 might they were killed and perhaps 300 injured given that this has been said by a responsible leading manipuri politician who was an ally of biryan saying until the start of May how do you respond to this claim 

AKH: before coming to that when you say they said that he's a responsible what do you say manipuri 

KT: origin

AKH: representing Manipur

KT: well his party has two mlas in the assembly 

AKH: Kuki People's Alliance they don't think Beyond Kuki they are fixed to kuki they are communal party they are communal organization they have communal mindsets that is the issue if they want to if they have to live in Manipur they should think broadly the way we do we always think about the totality of the state and regarding his claims about that I think lies of Kukis has become the new truth that is the most upset part they have been spreading lies after lies 

KT: This Is A Lie 

AKH: this is a lie I have I have sets of Lies which I can bring out to you with all the facts I will show you all right after this interview 

KT: it's only right and proper

AKH: one lie one big lie

KT: You should respond 

AKH: okay that's why one more one more bigger lie I will prove to you now you must be aware they have written a letter uh to various International forums and even the European Parliament has concluded that when in in the debate they resolve that the the current uh violence that happens in Manipur is of the Hindu majority targeting
 
KT: I'm aware of a letter written by COCOMI yeah I will come to that in a moment's time 

AKH: no we wrote that in clarification even in India also you must also be aware that in the second phase of their propaganda didn't they say that Christians are being targeted by the Hindu majority please say yes or no 

KT: not to me 

AKH: please say

KT: they didn't say to me 

AKH: don't you follow the news

KT: they didn't

AKH: don't you follow the propaganda

KT: no 

AKH: no you should come in truely the come on

KT: I will be honest with you I have

been told repeatedly both by Kuki and by my day that although attempts have been made to give the troubles in Manipur a religious color this is not a religious conflict it is essentially name one Kuki who said that to you name one Kuki 

KT: I'll name one certainly, Paolienlal haokip

AKH: who who

KT: he's a BJP say that

AKH: Paolienlal Haokip said that it's not againts the christians by the majority say that 

KT: listen to me carefully

AKH: no please answer

KT: listen to me carefully before you distort what I'm saying he and many others said that whilst it is acquiring a religious color sometimes by hindutva elements it is not primarily a religious dispute it is not primarily Hindu versus Christian it is primarily ethnic kuki versus he said that in several others said that listen carefully he didn't say it's not entirely of religious overtones it's acquiring that deliberately and Mr iralu speaking to me from nagaland was even clearer 

AKH: let's come to the kukis with people's propaganda here in Nationwide protest when I say that even the National papers, many of the Nationa papers that there's Christians being targeted by the majority Meitei Hindu you cannot you cannot run away from that propaganda spread by the disease 

KT: I will quote what your organization wait a second I will quote what your organization wrote to the European Parliament about 

AKH: that's a clarification 

KT: in that clarification you went on to say a moment

AKH: Let me prove that 

KT: let me finish talking before you start proving something in that letter that you wrote to the European parliament's president about a week or 10 days ago you said that might take Christians not Hindus might take Christians had been ethnically cleansed those were your words ethnically cleansed district and cycle that is what you accuse them that's not Hindu versus Christian that's kuki Christians you're accusing of killing meitei Christian it's very different to what you're saying here 

AKH: I was writing sorry we were writing to the European Parliament to clarify that their conclusion their resolutions that they resolve to state that the current uh violence in Manipur is being in a way that the kuki minority Christians tribal Christians are being targeted by the meitei majority but that's not Hindu versus Christian then is it is Christian versus Christian no they said meitei majority Hindus targeting the minority tribal Christians come to the you know please come on after that when they say that all across the the Nations will know when you telling us this interview people will know how you said how I said let me conclude 

KT: Dominic lumon and his Naga he's not Kuki the Archbishop of uh imphal has gone on record to the Indian Express I think it was the 18th of June he claims 249 churches in the valley have been demolished and he added he believes this was done deliberately because most people wouldn't know there were churches but it's not a kuki who made that charge it's the Archbishop of imphal and his Naga Dominic Luman he made the church it was in the papers don't you 

AKH: don't you listen to the other other narratives the meitei Christians and the uncle Christians came to Delhi had a press conference in the Constitution club and they clarify it's not on the Christian the rather the Christian churches in Churachandpur was destroyed by the Kuki Christians let's come to the point 

KT: Let's talk about that allegation it was made by the Meitei churches Christian Council yeah right yeah and the report was put together apparently by two young men one of whom is called Samuel father Babu Bhergese said to me in an interview that he'd met Samuel's father and Samuel's father had said this is a false narrative I.E the father of one of the authors went on record which Babu Bhergese told me to say it's false however the same Mr Bhergese did confirm that at least four meitei churches were destroyed in the Hills he confirmed that it was separately conformed to me by Professor him on 

ATH: so don't conclude that 

KT: I'm not concluded 

ATH: but coming to the point at this point maybe before yesterday day before yesterday I'm coming on the lies so 

KT: we can't go on about every lies 

ATH: one last point day before yesterday the archsbishop of Maharashtra Mumbai Mr Cardinal oswan clearly states that this is not between Christians and the Hindu it is rather between ethnic 

KT: but that's exactly what I've been saying

ATH: No you are

KT: I've been saying the samet thing to you 

ATH: no no no see the Nations the Kuki propaganda and the national media has been covering for quite some time during the whole month of May and the whole month of June that the Christians minority tribal Christians being targeted by Meitei Hindu which is completely false those were the lies selling by those people including them Mr hansing that is one example of the lie

KT: I will let you get it off your chest because it's only fair that if it's something that wrinkles so deeply you should say it happily said now let's come back to what I asked because I think it's important that you should respond how do you respond to the claim made by Mr hung Singh who's the general secretary of the Kuki People's Alliance he has two MLAs in the assembly till May he was supporting birencing how do you respond to his claim that an estimated 200 might say were killed and 300 perhaps injured when the common lock battle as I'm calling it happened on the 13th and 14th of June how do you respond to 

ATH: that that is also one another blatant lie and they are they are so convenient in spreading lies to the Nations and because of that they will never achieve their you know vested political interests number one number two every debt count on the side of the military volunteers or everyone it's been transparent they have been you know received from the MOG there is a procession there is a rituals but which is compulsory to be performed by the you know families and every single debt has been performed in that way so there is no question of hiding that but on the other side we don't have any account till that no medias have ever reported how many people died there are several close fires and exchanges but there is no report of any death from the other side they are performing a empty coffin rally empty 

KT: tell me something 

ATH: don't you see anything on this 

KT: since you raised this how many kukis do you think have been killed 

ATH: I have no idea we're suggesting that in fact there isn't any reports the only count that we know is the state's release of that counts which are in the mock and other places that's it 

KT: there's something else that I want to put you the common lock Village Chiefs that's the area where the battle happened on the 13th and 14th of June the carmenlock village Chiefs issued a statement on the 16th of June this is what it says the attack and assault on the kuki Villages was directly supervised and commanded by Chief Minister Biren Singh Minister bishwajeet Singh and like sambasana the rajya Sabha MP that same point was also corroborated by Mr hansing how do you respond to that 

ATH: they are all same group of people belongs to the drug Syndicate and the Narco terrorist group so they have same line of agenda same life 

KT: the Chiefs belong to the drug syndicate? 

ATH: they all have must belong they all have the same statement

KT: MR Hangsing also?

ATH: yeah and the thing is

KT: You are saying Mr Hong Shing belongs to a drug Syndicate 

ATH: definitely 

KT: and you're saying that the Khamenlog Village Chiefs belong to them 

ATH: definitely because they are they are there they are putting forth the same line of arguments same statements and the the very allegations are there they are making it's wild they have to come with proof it out we have no idea on that 

KT: my last question there is a growing body of opinion in the country and maybe even within the BJP although the BJP doesn't say it openly that Biren Singh has failed to handle the crisis even though 87 88 days have gone by maybe 90. has the time come to replace Biren Singh in the interest of solving the problem 

ATH: as per my knowledge I think the charge of Home has been already replaced by one of the appointment from the center Mr 

KT: Kuldeep Sing

ATH: he's in charge he's head of the Unified High command but not just a security advisor he he controls everything 

KT: but Biren Singh remains chief minister and one reason why 

ATH: he must be taking care of other administrative Affairs but the rather the important security measures are completely controlled by kuldeep Singh we have been frequently you know communicating and meeting with him we know the level of controlling 

KT: so you're saying most critical paths have already been taken away from Biren

ATH: yeah right from the first day kuldeep Singh was appointed 

KT: so Biren Singh is a sort of hollow puppet
 
ATH: what do you mean by Hollow puppet

KT: powerless 

ATH: he's taking care of other administrative Affairs as I told you 

KT: but not security 

ATH: not security 

KT: which is the main concern at the moment the debt has been already described by the I think the center has already 

KT: so is there anything to remove him
 
ATH: no removing him or not it's up to the center 

KT: of course I'm asking you 

ATH:for us we have a team we have a Democratic elected popular government and we believe and we have to trust on that rather than trusting on the some sort of you know uh uh what do you say the president

KT: But what is the official position of COCOMI you're the spokesman Should Biren Singh be retained or should he be removed 

ATH: he should be retained

KT: retain

ATH: yeah not Biren Singh, state government should retain

KT: I take it then on the question of president's rule your answer is there's no need for that 

ATH: no president rules don't one work in Manipur because we already had a very you know bitter president rules experience in the past the 2001 where the whole assembly was thoughts down it's because of the president rule even today the security person is deployed in Manipur are finding difficulties you know why because they don't know the terrain they don't know the geography they don't understand the history so president's rule is the wrong thing no no no it's not 

KT: so the final position is it is wrong to demand the resignation of Biren Singh 

ATH: I don't think so yeah 

KT: thank you very much for this interview

ATH: thank you thank you
