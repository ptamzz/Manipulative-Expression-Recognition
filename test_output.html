    I am not telling you what the issue is just so you can decide whether or not my problem is significant enough for you to be concerned about. I am not telling you. Forget it.

    You’re not really getting ready for work, are you? Why are you texting me if you are so busy?? You’re not busy. You’re just avoiding me! I don’t have to take your abuse. You make me feel like a piece of garbage, like nothing I have to say is important. You don’t care about me at all!

    It’s been 30 minutes, and you still haven’t called. What is taking so long? I bet you are texting someone else. Probably one of your many admirers…I am surprised you have any time for anything else. Must feel great having all those people to talk to who stroke your ego any time you want. You know they only talk to you because they want to sleep with you, right? They are all the same, and you love it, just admit it. You love the attention. JUST SAY IT

<br><br>Person B: I can’t deal with this craziness today. I have a big day ahead. Can you knock it off? If you’re still upset at lunch, let’s chat.<br><br>Person A: 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    I must talk to you NOW, and your day is NOT going to dictate what I get from you. You WILL CALL or you will see a very different side of me real soon.

<br><br>Person B: You mean a more fun side than this? Can’t wait.<br><br>Person A: 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    THAT’S IT!! YOU HAVE PISSED ME OFF FOR THE LAST TIME! MARK MY WORDS YOU WILL BE SORRY. I HAVE A MEETING NOW. GO AWAY.

    OK?!?!?!? is that all you have to say? Just okay? God, what kind of horrible worthless piece of garbage must you think I am in order to treat me like this?

<br><br>…..and on and on for an hour or more…<br><br>…and then later, after work:<br><br>Person A: Hey, let’s get a drink.<br><br>Person B: I don’t want to. No.<br><br>Person A: 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    So you hate me now? Should I just not contact you ever again? Is that how it is? Tell me, so I won’t have to waste another minute of my life talking to you.
