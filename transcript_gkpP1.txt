KT: Hello & welcome to a special interview for the wire. Tomorrow the Manipur assembly meets for its Monsoon session & today we ask how effectively have governments in Delhi & Imphal handle the crisis & more importantly what are the steps necessary to handle the Law & Order situation & beyond that the tricky but not irresolvable political issues that underlight those are the key concerns I should raise today with the former Home Secretary whose knowledge of the Northeast & Manipur in particular is not just unsurpassed it's also unrivaled.

Mr pillay, tomorrow Tuesday the 29th the Manipur assembly will convene for its
Monsoon session for just one day but it's already clear that all 10 Kuki MLAs, two of whom are Minister seven are in fact from the BJP will boycott the session & at least two national newspapers the Hindu & the times of India suggest that even the 10 Naga mp skips the session in which case Beyond meeting constitutional requirements what real purpose does this one day session serve?

GKP:  I don't think it really serves any purpose except to show that one instrument of the administration, the Constitutional, is still alive & kicking nothing more than that.

KT: in fact isn't that a danger that if all 20 Naga & Kuki mlas do not attend
the session it would be an all-mate session & that will deeply underline
how deep & how perhaps irreversible the division in Manipur has become

GKP:  I'm not so sure yet of whether the Naga mlas would not attend the session although two newspapers the Hindu & the times of India have suggested they wanted it if they do I mean it it only sends a political signal of how isolated in one sense the Meiteis are from the rest of the population in Manipur & that would in a sense bring home to the rest of India how deep & perhaps irreversible this divide is becoming well the division is very deep whether it's irreversible I would still wait to see how the developments take place on the various steps which need to be taken by the government & whether they would take those steps

KT: I want very much to talk to you about the steps that need to be taken & I want to talk about those steps in terms of different issues that occur Law & Order the political issues the background issues but before I come to that let me ask you first for your assessment of the way governments both in Delhi & in far have so far handled this crisis what is your assessment of Chief Minister Biren Singh's handling over almost the last four months

GKP:  I think what we have to realize is that there has been a constitutional breakdown the state government has been more shall I say explicit by its absence rather than its presence across all of Manipur including the Meitei dominated areas & to that extent what was mentioned in the Supreme Court I don't have to one of the justices in the Supreme Court itself mentioned there is an apparent Constitution breakdown

KT: In that case should the chief minister be replaced?

GKP:  That is a political decision for the government of India to take & I think with the government's being of the same both BJP governments in center & the state it is unlikely that if they have not taken decisions so far that they would take such a decision or in the future…

KT: Although not so recent past Indira Gandhi dismissed in Punjab when they she felt that they were failing to handle the situation visa & that was a congress government dismissed by a
congress prime minister so the president exists & I believe Nero did that in his time as well surely the interest of Manipur should be Paramount not the party interest of the BJP which is why I asked because clearly this is the chief minister whose lost the confidence of the Kuki people that's 16 percent & several newspaper accounts say 15 of his 32 mlas including eight Maite have also publicly expressed a loss of confidence in him so is he an obstacle now

GKP:  I don't think so I don't see the political party in power sees it that way because if they saw it they would then remove him it might happen in the future it's quite possible but at the moment I don't see the government removing him because they feel that he serves a particular political purpose

KT: in fact the home minister in his speech in the Lok Sabha
said he was being retained because he's in quotes cooperating & that was in terms of removing the chief secretary to moving the dtp accepting kuldeep Singh but as a former Home Secretary who clearly puts the interest of Manipur before the politics does cooperating make up for the fact
that he's been incompetent in restoring Law & Order does it make up for the fact that he's unacceptable to 16 of his population & perhaps pretty close to 50 percent of his own MLAs

GKP:  See it's a question of one is the Constitutional propriety & the other is the political aspects & then obviously in this case the political issues have taken priority over constitutional aspects & it's very clear

KT: is that unfortunate in your eyes

GKP: it is unfortunate yes because it sends a wrong signal not just to Manipur it sends a wrong signal to one all the states in India & especially other states in the northeast of India 

KT: so retaining Biren Singh is sending the wrong signal 

GKP:  yes I think I have no doubt about it

KT: let's come to the handling of the situation by the central government in the speech that he made in the Lok Sabha when the no confidence & debate happened the home minister spoke for two hours & he explained the present crisis in terms of an influx of illegal refugees Kuki refugees from Myanmar from 2021. now there's no doubt that is precisely how the might they believed the situation has arisen but the Kuki have a very different explanation did the home minister make a mistake in only giving the explanation from one side rather than from both sides has he ended up perhaps inadvertently making himself look partisan

GKP:  see once you have supported the chief minister & not dismissed the chief minister then you have to follow The Narrative of the chief minister & that is exactly what the Union home minister has done so that was expected because if we had to follow any other narrative then it would mean that he would have to dismiss the chief minister

KT: & this follows from you're saying that retaining Biren Singh sends a wrong message to Manipur therefore the explanation as far as the Kukis are concerned sends the wrong message to them as well yes

GKP:  no doubt about it 

KT: & I presume this is why the Kukis have responded so angrily towards the home minister said in Parliament the list of Kuki organizations who've condemned the home Minister's speech is pretty long it's the Kuki INPI the indigenous tribal leaders Forum the committee on tribal unity & all 10 Kuki mlas including seven who are from the home Minister's own BJP party doesn't this mean that at the time when the home minister needed to reconcile the Kuki & the Meitei & therefore reach out to the Kuki he's ended up offending & annoying them instead

GKP:  well that is what uh I think the strategy was so I don't uh you know find any uh anything new this has been the strategy of the BJP & therefore it just he's just following that line 

KT:  can you explain that further Mr Pilai you believe the strategy of the BJP is to side with the Meitei & push the Kuki aside 

GKP:  well that's what they've done in in actual practice that's what they've done so it's it's something unfortunate what it's happened & the consequences are there which we have seen & now we have in one sense to pick up the pieces & see where did we take them forward 

KT: You are saying something very important & I'm only repeat but you're actually saying the government of India has taken sides in the Meitei Kuki conflict & it's taken the side of the Meitei yes

GKP:  no doubt about it 

KT: this is truly unfortunate isn't it 

GKP:  it's unfortunate but that's politics today

KT: if you had been home secretary & you saw this happening what would you have said to the home minister 

GKP:  No I think first most important thing is that you have to maintain Law & Order & if you find that the state government because Law & Order is the state subject if they are unable to maintain that then I think you have to take what action follows from that you're suggesting that if you were home secretary & the law & order was not under control it was said to the home minister dispense with your chief minister yes I think if he could not control the situation & the Law & Order situation went out of control as it went & you had a complete breakdown of Law & Order then I think you really need in one sense to have dismissed the chief minister because that I think was you could you don't have to impose president's rule but you have to get could get have got rid of him & brought in somebody else who you could try & if he still failed then the only other option is President's rule 

KT:  so I'll sum up this which you're saying two very important one that's a strategy to be is using in Manipur which is to take sides with the Meitei against the Kuki is the wrong strategy it's unfortunate & secondly retaining experiencing is Chief Minister which follows from that strategy is another terrible mistake yes it is I think in the long term it's a mistake let's come to the prime minister's handling for 79 days he refused to speak in public about money but not a single syllable thereafter if you count up the occasions when he's spoken about Manipur it comes to a total of under 10 minutes which means in nearly four months the prime minister of India has spent less than 10 minutes speaking about one of the worst crises India faces as a former Home Secretary what do you make of that I think the Prime Minister has left it to the home minister to take a call

GKP:  I think this is one it's a it's again a decision it's a decision that he has taken he thinks the home minister is handling it & he doesn't want to interfere with what the home minister is doing therefore he's kept his shall I say minimal uh approach rather than intervene directly

KT: given the seriousness of the crisis on the fact that it's carried on four months was the Prime Minister right to leave this entirely to the home minister 

GKP:  It’s a difficult call for me to make it's a it's a prime minister as of India he takes the call he's I think politically very astute so he's taken the call I think very deliberately & very in a measured way so we'll have to see how things pan out in the months to come to see whether that call was right or wrong

KT: earlier when we were talking about the home minister you said he has consciously put politics BJP politics ahead of India's constitutional requirements that it seems is also true of Mr Modi

GKP:  see let's let's see how things it's already the matter is before The Supreme Court issues which are coming I think we'll see how how it pans out

Kt: practically everyone I've spoken to in Manipur & in the last four months I think I've done about 30 31 interviews whether these guests were Meitei Kuki Meiteis, they've all said they feel let down by the Prime Minister many have said they think the Prime Minister has done their back on them one of them even said to me we can't even see the prime minister's then are people in Manipur justified in feeding & thinking like this 

GKP:  see I think you are in a state you are trying to make depending on the Prime Minister for trying to solve all your local problems your local problems have to be solved at the local level & I think you have if you cannot expect the prime minister to solve the problem uh especially as complex & complicated just by the Prime Minister intervening it's it's a matter which you have to solve yourself & I think if you are not able to solve it there are other constitutional remedies which of course had not been taken but you have to solve the problem by discussion & dialogue among the groups in Manipur itself 

KT: my last question about the Prime Minister many people say many people in Manipur that he's not just the most popular person in the country he's by far the most powerful what he to take an initiative for he to fly in for a day were he to invite Civil Society organizations to meet him he would give a message that he personally cares & that would encourage people to talk perhaps to reconcile that initiative needed to be taken by him they say how do you respond to that 

GKP:  I think if any prime minister when I said in a situation of this nature needs to reach out to the people because they are all his uh he's a prime minister of all of India & therefore he needs to reach out uh at the earliest when the situation unless as a unless there is you know the intelligence briefings & the other reports which is getting are totally different in which case there's another that's another issue but if the reports are what has come out in the newspapers & has come out through the discussions that you've brought out in some of your interviews as well as the reports of people who have gone there of different parties & different makes it shows a real issue possibly unheard of in post-independence India & I think the Prime Minister would have been well advised to have intervened personally & then see where it goes from there

KT: so you're saying the Prime Minister needed to reach out in the early stages

GKP:  yes at least I think after the after the Union Home Minister's visit ah which is good the Union home minister is spending three days in Manipur is unheard of in any uh laundered situation in the country Post Independent India when that didn't work I think the Prime Minister should have stepped in right calling people to him or by visiting Manipur he could have visited Manipur he could have called people across anyway just the fact that the prime minister is concerned about the situation would have made a tremendous difference because people of the Northeast whether it's Meitei whether it's Kukis whether it's Zomis Paites & so on all of them are the human touch is very very critical for them that somebody cares & it would make a tremendous impact

KT:  by failing to reach out by failing to give that human touch to use your words that somebody cares & let's be honest Mr Modi is very good at doing it when he wants to has he in the case of Manipur been irresponsible

GKP:  I would say you see it's a call that he made the wrong call it's a call that that's for him to take because he said he would have left it to the Union home minister to take the decision he may have felt that his interfering would undermine the Union Home Minister's position any any I mean any number of reasons they could be uh & he thought of felt that his in his uh interference at the early stages uh may have been wrong how I personally feel that his intervention would have had a very salutary effect on the situation but that is my my view others may feel different 

KT: absolutely so in your personal opinion he took the wrong call 

GKP:  in my personal opinion he should have reached out to the people in Manipur even perhaps visited Manipur or at least he should have called everybody over at least the least he could have done was to call everybody over to Delhi for talks in the first week or 10 days

KT:  let's now with this in the background come to steps that are necessary to tackle the problem & let's start with the law & order issue because I imagine that's the most immediate concern if the hormone is true to pick up the phone & say Gopal no one knows the Northeast better than you no one understands Manipur better than you what is your advice to me with regard to tackling Law & Order what would you say 

GKP:  well first I think is you have to what shall I say reduce the number of arms with the civilian population I think the number one priority would be in terms of the law & order I'll come to the relief Rehabilitation separately is the recovery of the 4000 odd weapons which are looted from the police armories you can't have three thousand four thousand arms floating around in the civilian population & expect situation to calm down so that is one number one priority…

KT: I imagine that the police & the security advisors are doing their best to try & recover the weapon what is it that they should be doing that clearly they haven't done that would recover weapons quickly 

GKP:  see two things as I put it one I think every single officer in charge of the armories from where it is looted should have been first dismissed from service pure dereliction of Duty it's not it's on this is the first time it's happening in this sort of case second to a large extent people know who's who dams who with whom they are & you should by now have been raiding houses across Manipur to recover These Arms which is not happened & you put drop boxes I mean it's the most ridiculous a situation that after you loot arms are looted you put drop boxes in different parts expect the people who have looted the arms to come & drop the weapons in that is one aspect second I think you have to start slowly initially yes…

KT: can I interrupt that point before you come to Second aspect a corollary of what you said that people are aware who's got the arms & they should have been reading their houses if they haven't done that & they know who's got the arms then there's a sense in which they're quite happy for them to keep the arms 

GKP: yes which which is why you're not seeing these raids I mean if if I was the DGP of Manipur even if not the old the new dgp has come in if I was the SP in imphal or Churachandpur & so on my first priority would be to recover these weapons these are police weapons so identifiable then the numbers are there & so on & so forth you can you should be raiding houses to recover these 

KT: & if you don't raid the houses Simplicity or at least acceptance that they're part of weapons & we don't mind them having the weapons 

GKP: yes definitely there's no doubt about it because by now if you three months has gone by more than three months have gone if you haven't been reading those to get the weapons back that's a I mean that is one key aspect for controlling the uh launder the situation bringing the violence down come to the second I interrupted you please come to the second the the second aspect in terms of which is the issue of filing these cases which are now of course some cases with the Supreme Court Etc the those cases which will go to Assam cases which are within itself opening up of you have to you have to open up supply lines because you if you block supply lens whether it's by the Meiteis or buy the Kukis Etc it's not good & 

KT: so forcibly those highways must be clear of blockades

GKP:  the highways must be cleared of blockades you can have I think initially you still need possibly for the next six months you still need the buffer zones as still the situation the violence comes down Etc couple of steps they have taken which I have seen which I'll mention partly Also earlier like they posted some tribal officers to the hill districts who have now all India service officers which gives some confidence to the people that okay we've got people whom we know we we are we can trust them they have come to do you need also to get what I what I call as start now of course CBI has taken over some cases but there are other cases which people & like yesterday you saw three houses burned down which is what you are trying you're trying to basically send a message to the Kukis & the zombies we are not welcome back three months have gone by we've half burnt your house now we have you know completely burning down your houses so message don't even think of coming back though personally I think none of them will come back but that's another issue so again two two three weapons looted from residents of some director health or something I mean you can't allow this sort of slackness somebody has to be held responsible which is why I said dismiss the officers & they are both both in the hill districts & in the valley none of them have been dismissed so far not not one so moment you dismiss it you are sending a signal this will not be tolerated at least the next time somebody comes to lutein Armory people will open fire I mean it's you just can't allow that to happen 

KT: you know as I hear you speak the things you are suggesting are obvious there are things that should have been done immediately & yet they haven't been done what does that tell us about the attitude & performance of a whole lot of function is not just the chief minister but I'm not excluding it but the DGP the security advisor the SPs the whole administration of State

GKP: a totally unprofessional I I you want to put it I would even say incompetent because if 4000 weapons have been looted & by now you haven't been doing raids I mean you saw I mean cases when rights take place & so on & so forth first thing that you do if there's weapons have been used by anybody else people read how is it see people have to the civilians have to feel a little bit uncomfortable that this will not be therefore the next time they try to do this they will be second thoughts whereas if they feel that nothing is going to happen to them in fact by failing to read you're giving them cut blush or encourage them to carry on yeah you're telling them that government has actually told you keep the arms

KT: are there other steps that you would advise to the home minister if hearings you up to tackle Law & Order one of them is get back the weapons raid if need be the second is file the case is prosecute them are there other steps in terms of Law & Order 

GKP: see these are the these are the first steps then you start the second process of what I call as giving the relief Rehabilitation & competition part of it which is not but it is equally important because ah from the relief camps itself & stories that both sides the relief camps youngsters & all are going now into what you call as you know Village Defense Forces & so on & so forth so if you don't give confidence to the youngsters that you are to go & study in the school or you are providing some online education & so on within the relief camps itself but then your first priority is to go & get arms training from civilians to protect your own villages that's a failure of the state because the state is supposed to protect the citizens you don't expect the citizens to take arms to protect themselves

KT: people like harshmander who visited with his karma people from the church who are present including Meitei people in the valley all tell me that the majority of the relief is being provided in the camps not by the state but by civil solidarity groups by the church or by my table in other words the state has opted out of doing what it should be doing

GKP: Yes I think that that has been one absence you there are two two three things the state can do the state has a limited capacity I mean Manipur government is not a it's not like you know you would find say Maharashtra or Karnataka or a Delhi government Etc where you know the capacity of the state is limited it's a small state a small number of offices etcetera a very large community organizations are there so it's it's all right that the community organizations come forward but the state must provide money but provide the say like for housing the prefabric housing they must be able to provide the doctors from the government hospitals & so on because most of the hospitals are the medical colleges and so on they should be able to provide other clothing & so on & so forth uh the relief & compensation which would have been expected from a state ah has not come & it's a it's actually a tribute to the strength of community organizations in Manipur both Maite as well as the Christian organizations that they have been able to get in fact we have a an IAS officer in Manipur Uh current Meitei officer who has actually reached out to the IIs Community through his batchmates & money has actually flowed from our groups WhatsApp groups to his NGO which is actually…

KT: but that is an individual taking an initiative not the state…

GKP: state rather than the state…

KT: but in fact you mentioned the need for Doctors Medical Care you mentioned the need for money newspaper reports when I'm going entirely by them suggest very little of the money that promised has actually reached people whether it's up in the hills whether it's down in the valley & as far as the Kuki are concerned in the Hills there is a real crisis of medical treatment doctors are absent medicine supplies are absent they're having to travel in some instances to nagaland or Assam & some reports suggest that people who are critically ill have died

GKP: yes I think my my information itself tells me that the number of people who have died in these camps has crossed 50. So when you say that 100 & some odd people were killed in the rights you almost got another 35 to 40 percent people have died post riots in the camps for out of various illnesses…

KT: this is because of the inefficiency or incompetence of the state Administration

GKP: you see not being able to provide the adequate Health in fact I would have expected even from the government of India that they should have started Health Facilities from Modern Age to Medical sciences & so on so forth doctors from various places should have been sent 30 40 doctors should have been sent for by rotation for a month two months to many of these relief camps just to provide the basic health Facilities

KT: not only have they not been sent by the government of India it seems it hasn't even occurred to the government of India that this is needed to do

GKP: No, they are aware. I think the uh union health home minister had promised that 50 Medical Teams would be sent
